00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 Hello on day two on CCC Camp 2023.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.440
 We are here at Bits and Boymay if I'm not mistaken, yes.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.400
 Thank you, thanks for the confirmation.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.320
 As you probably know, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 There are services that people are denied or

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.680
 that are buried behind legal barriers that cost a lot of money,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.800
 a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of knowledge, and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 language knowledge, and all the other stuff to get behind to.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.280
 So here, our next speaker is here to talk about how technology

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.840
 could address the cost and help these people defend their human rights.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 So please welcome with a very warm round of applause for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.440
 Access to Justice for Human-Centered Design Tech, Viraj.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.800
 >> Hey all, just wanted to say firstly, thank you for coming.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.320
 I appreciate it.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480
 This talk is largely gonna be about human rights issues that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.960
 I've encountered, human rights issues that I've encountered while working.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 And then kind of use technology to address these issues.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.680
 If you guys wanna ask questions or

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 just chat throughout my presentation, feel free to do so.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 So I'll- >> [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.120
 >> Like this, is this better?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.440
 Okay, thank you.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.040
 Yeah, so I think the first slide's gonna go through specifically my experience.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 But then also, I think the first question to ask for

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200
 is whether technology should even have a place.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.560
 So on the left is places where I worked and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.760
 have seen technology to really help.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.800
 I was a refugee lawyer, so I conduct refugee applications.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.120
 A lot of it is form filling before you get to the courts.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.600
 Police accountability, it's more how do you actually stop police and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 then provide accountability during the interaction.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.480
 Genocide in Myanmar, we found that a lot of people that in internal displaced camps

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.600
 would have access to phones, but they didn't have access to any other type of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.840
 information.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.160
 General legal advice, I'll talk about that more in the next slide.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.760
 But where I've really found that technology did not have a role was in

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.720
 First Nations or indigenous populations where no one has a phone,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.840
 you don't have landlines, you don't have access to computers at all.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 And they are still trying to be interventions through technology to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.480
 address some type of structural problems in remote communities.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 So this is one example where I think technology should have a role.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.960
 And prototype fund has, they funded one of my projects called my rights.info,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.040
 which applies human centered design principles to the European Court of Human

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.120
 Rights.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.000
 And this is the world's largest human rights database in terms of case law.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 This court produces the most amount of cases that has ever existed on human

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.280
 rights.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.000
 But its functionality is so flawed that if you filter by English,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.080
 you'll get cases that are only available in French.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.920
 So as a lawyer, this has, like it first to me sounded funny, but

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.320
 then it became quite problematic quickly.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.120
 So if a refugee comes into my office and then I start looking for

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.440
 cases that are descriptive of their issues to start advocating for them,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.040
 I have no comfort that if I type in their factual description,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.920
 that I'll actually see the cases that apply to this person.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.240
 There's no comfort at all.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.200
 And for me, that's quite scary if it's like,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.560
 especially if it's in a human rights situation.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.640
 If it's something like tax or commerce, it's a little bit less scary because their

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.880
 lives literally not at danger.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.160
 So this is where I think tech would have a role and should have a role.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.080
 So I'll go into some of the project that I worked on,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.760
 structural problems that I've seen.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.440
 And then how I think technology should be viewed to change human rights issues.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.400
 The first one I'd like to talk about is police accountability.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.520
 And then this is how my journey in human rights started.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.400
 When I was 18, I was arrested without charge, put into cells overnight,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.720
 did not know what happened.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.640
 I'd been searched multiple times throughout my life.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.280
 And then at this point, I was always looking at what could I have done in that

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.800
 situation, what information should have had at that situation that could have

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.720
 helped, and then after that violation happened,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.440
 how could I obtain some type of remedy?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.920
 And then that's kind of what put me into the crack of law, human rights and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.880
 tech, because if you, and in that situation, I wasn't able to access lawyers.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.760
 I didn't have money.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.520
 I didn't have information about, like my family didn't know lawyers.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.080
 They didn't know the system, right?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.800
 So it's like, can I challenge this?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.920
 How should I challenge this?

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.600
 I knew something bad happened to me, but I felt powerless.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.360
 I made an app in New Zealand that basically tells people,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.160
 it's not what not to do, which is how the law is framed, right?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.360
 Don't commit a crime.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 Don't do X.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.440
 But it tells people what they can do.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.400
 Everything's linked to specific case law where people have,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.120
 where people successfully challenge the cops.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.360
 You can also see case law where the judge will literally say that police have been

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.840
 caught to be lying, forging evidence.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.160
 And if most of the information that exists about police accountability, again,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.120
 is these are your rights, this is what you can do, this is what you can't do.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.600
 But I think the narrative really needs to change to be something like the people

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.400
 that are going to be stopping you are trying to violate your rights.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.720
 And in that situation, you have to take proactive action.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.120
 So the police accountability app that I made, it records the police, and

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.280
 then also depending on which factual scenario you're in,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.560
 will lead you to a set of information.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.960
 So if, are you walking in public?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.200
 Are you walking down the street?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.800
 So it's kind of like having a lawyer in your pocket.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.240
 That if a police officer stops you, you can be like, hey,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.680
 I'm not holding anything.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.520
 Like, you don't have the right to do this for me.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.320
 It tells you what to say, and everything's linked out to the case law.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.320
 The second issue that I've had was as a refugee lawyer, you get a lot of

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.920
 situations where a refugee will come into your office or other client's offices.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.400
 And they've suffered political persecution, like grievous bodily harm.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040
 They've seen multiple people dying around them.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.280
 But they can't speak English, and they don't know what the legal process is.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.600
 When you're working at a not-for-profit legal space,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.400
 you have about 20 minutes, I'd say, at maximum with each refugee.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.640
 The classic situation that happens is a refugee will come in, and

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.720
 they immediately start talking about the harm that they've faced.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.680
 And that's obvious, right?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.480
 But that's not the information a lawyer requires to actually advance their claim.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.760
 This literally results in this, like I've seen it happen multitudes of time,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.200
 where you'll have to tell the person, hey, stop, we need this information.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.920
 People are gonna cry, they're emotional.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.520
 And then the questions that you have to ask are,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.040
 how many family members do you have in Australia?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.800
 And obviously, the future will be like, why?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.120
 Why are you asking me this?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.800
 This has nothing to do with my harm.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.400
 And the majority of time that you spend on these type of humanitarian visa

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.960
 applications is completely bureaucratic.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.120
 There's also an issue that, so that in addition to these interviewing issues,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.080
 you have invisible requirements.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080
 So let's say that you, again, the same question.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.920
 There's a field that says, do you have family in Australia?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.960
 If you are a competent refugee and you can speak English and you have the ability,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.720
 let's say you were a lawyer in your home country and you can fill out a form,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.680
 you could submit this form and your form would fail.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.600
 Because these certain paragraphs have invisible requirements,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.000
 which you're only told once you've failed.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.600
 So in that same places, do you have family in Australia?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.160
 You have to put commas slash slashes and say where they live and

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.640
 also provide contact information.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.200
 And this information's not on that form.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.720
 So basically, what I started building was a refugee form filler,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.280
 where you can change the question language to any language that you're in.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.360
 It also has decision key logic.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.720
 That same form, it's called the 861 application form,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.520
 asks you for your name eight times, right?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.000
 And section three will be like, give out your family information,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.920
 even though you would say, no, I have no family in the first question.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.320
 So you can use decision key logic to really simplify this process.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.160
 But the biggest thing is that if you translate this form to Arabic,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.680
 now you have your client who's actually aware of the process that they're going

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.200
 through.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.280
 They know the challenge that you're facing and the problem to solve.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.120
 So again, it's like looking at technology, it's not so much like,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.760
 we're just gonna make this application easier.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.080
 But it's literally about allowing people to empower themselves through the process

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.000
 that you're engaging in.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.720
 And the next project that I've working on is general legal advice,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.160
 which I think brings this together.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.760
 So prototype funded a project that I'm working on called myrightstoreinfo,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.240
 which relates to this database.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.600
 Myrightstoreinfo took, the purpose of it was people don't understand the law,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.000
 cuz it's complex.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.840
 It's hard to access a terrible database that doesn't even work if you imagine

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.680
 that it works by principle.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.040
 And it was how, if you're walking down the street and

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.360
 a police officer stopped you, or let's say your child was taken away by

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.120
 social services and you don't know what your rights are.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.240
 How do you solve this problem?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.480
 And what's the best way of going about this?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.000
 And again, it was kind of look from the human center design principle of looking

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.800
 at the problem and looking up instead of looking down on how to provide information.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.040
 So myrightstoreinfo has three different points that you can access this

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.120
 information for three different audience members.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.000
 The first is by filling out a questionnaire that just has binary options,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.440
 like did this harm happen to you, yes or no.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.200
 At the end of that questionnaire, you'll be presented with the violations that

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 apply to you.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.280
 You can go further and then look at all the cases that apply to you.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.920
 Then there's also the second application,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.960
 which is looking at law more in terms of a social aspect.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.800
 So all the cases in this database have been fed into an infographic.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.400
 So if you're a researcher and you wanna see, hey, how did the court

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.600
 start deciding on, let's say, gay marriage rights?

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.200
 And at what year did they do this?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.720
 And how did they look at that compared to the right to torture?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.800
 Now you can choose which articles that you wanna view across a timeframe and

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.080
 then see what the court is thinking.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.520
 And the third one is just, it's an advanced text search feature,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.320
 which is like your classic search feature.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.440
 But again, something that the QDoc database doesn't do,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.560
 is they don't even have a spell check.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.920
 And legal names are difficult and law words are difficult.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.080
 So I think just introducing a spell check has made a huge improvement in

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.360
 the lives of lawyers.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.360
 So it's kind of just looking at basic access principles,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.280
 basic human centered design principles to break down these problems.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:46.680
 So as I was saying, everything is designed with accessibility in mind.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.880
 And I think one of the issues that really comes to play is that the average

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.160
 reading age, I probably shouldn't have talked.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.720
 >> You feel really hot?

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.800
 >> It's a good place.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.360
 >> 23.5 degrees Celsius.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.200
 >> Let's go to the lake.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.800
 >> Drink enough water and have a great time.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.760
 >> You get two more minutes.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.280
 >> Two minutes?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.240
 >> No, no, you get the dish in two minutes.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.560
 >> I just feel bad if some really important information was provided.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.080
 Yeah, okay.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.160
 [LAUGH]

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.040
 So the average reading age of the world is the age of a ten year old.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.200
 Legal information, I find difficult to understand.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.080
 So how do you provide, you can't even achieve a basic accessibility

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.240
 principle just on the information that you're seeing.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.800
 So how do you solve this, right?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.280
 It's such a weird obstacle that everyone here is owed human rights, but

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.960
 I doubt 95% of people even know what that means and

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.800
 how to actually use your rights.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.720
 And it's done by, I think it's done by purpose.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.920
 But so this My Rights for Info is also looking at it from not just accessibility,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.000
 but people that have accessibility issues also need to be able to access the law.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.080
 And most legal information websites don't have this.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.840
 So the entire website's built in grayscale,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.560
 which allows people with visual disabilities to be able to access the information.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.320
 Everything apart from the legal information that's provided is written that

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.320
 a ten year old can understand this.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.320
 Screen readers are utilized, so if you have visual impairments as well,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.120
 you can utilize the screen reader to start understanding legal information.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.080
 And I think that's also a really big gap,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.080
 is targeting invisible populations that have their rights discriminated, but

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.120
 then also targeting them to actually receive rights-based information that

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.080
 they can utilize.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.000
 And that's the end of the show.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.520
 If anyone has questions, feel free to ask.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.840
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.840
 >> So no need for additional two minutes, awesome.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.160
 >> Unless we have very many questions.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.280
 Let's start with the first one.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.920
 >> Thank you very much, it was a really nice talk.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.640
 And I'm really, really happy, so I'm actually part of a project called

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.080
 Access to Justice, funny enough.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.320
 Much smaller scope, so it's kind of German perspective.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.000
 And we have two kind of projects, and one is kind of open data for

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.160
 law and cases and so on, so kind of the third part.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.840
 And the second project is on kind of simplifying access for

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.080
 getting your rights, so kind of form filler.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.560
 So it's super nice that you kind of exactly talked about these two projects.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.240
 And yeah, I think it's really, really hard to build services that

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.640
 work for everyone and that do the right thing.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.800
 And we're kind of also trying to do the next step of actually sending your,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.880
 like filling out your form and actually sending it digitally,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.400
 which currently isn't possible in Germany.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.600
 As a private person,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.640
 you can't send anything into the digital justice system in Germany.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.000
 Only lawyers can do this.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.640
 This is supposed to come, who knows, like Q1 this year, supposedly.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.840
 But postponed.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.400
 So yeah, I would love to chat afterwards.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.640
 And yeah, accessibility is super important, and we're trying to test this.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.240
 And it's really hard, but at least it's really nice that you're doing this and

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.600
 people are working on this.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.720
 >> Yeah, and I should say all the tools that I've built,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.880
 I'm still like a practicing lawyer.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.400
 And I think, unfortunately, any human rights system that's not radical in

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.360
 nature has to be conformed to the actual limits of the system.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.600
 So most of the tools that I create will help people that will really reduce this

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.800
 distress of a lawyer, right?

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.640
 Like tries to take away 80% of their work where they can just focus on

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.160
 the substantive aspect.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.880
 So even if you do have this form filling exercise,

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.200
 as you've correctly pointed out, you still have to send it to a lawyer.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.120
 A lawyer will never believe anyone apart from themselves.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.960
 So they'll still check everything.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.160
 But if you can make their lives easier, they could focus on more clients per day,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.120
 focus on the tougher challenges.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.160
 And Australia and New Zealand, where these applications are predominantly made,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.560
 apart from my rights for info, unfortunately,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.560
 I think a lawyer still has to be in the picture.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.840
 >> Next question over here.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.920
 >> First of all, thank you so much.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.720
 This has been enlightening.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.200
 And one thing that I wonder is, in the aspect,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.160
 I understand that you are building technology and

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.720
 that you are working with these people who need aid.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.200
 My question is, how do you get to those people?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.120
 Because most of the time when they need that help, they don't know where to find it.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.120
 And that is something that as hacktivists,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.440
 we have all these spaces that we can help, but

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.920
 there's no way to reach someone that really needs it.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.680
 Right now, because we are small, we are not fully funded.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.560
 >> Yeah, so this is my personal experience.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.440
 I don't know if I can provide advice generally, but I've always worked as a

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.000
 lawyer and then in activist communities.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.760
 And I know the issue that you're talking about.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.920
 So the police accountability app that I've made, certain communities in

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.800
 Australia will see any app as something that they can't trust and rely.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.440
 But I was part of Melbourne activist legal support where we go into protests and

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.400
 then provide legal advice to people that have stopped completely.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.000
 I sued the police for a living basically.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.680
 So I did have groups where, thank you.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.960
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.040
 >> I had groups that I could gain trust and

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.160
 knowledge and I think that's also another big thing with technology.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.600
 You have to be invested in that community.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.320
 You have to be part of it for that really to have any type of hold and trust.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.240
 I don't know if that answers your question, but that's how I went about it.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.000
 >> Totally, it's exactly what we do.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.240
 >> Can you look into the microphone, please?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.840
 >> No, yes.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.880
 >> All right, cool.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.360
 Further questions apart from, behind me, sorry.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:08.000
 >> Hi, I was listening to you on live stream and I just rushed here.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.280
 >> Thank you. >> Because I didn't want to miss

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.520
 the question.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.360
 But this is not a question actually.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.120
 I'm a designer and I was wondering if there is any way we could help you do

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.240
 these things because I work with accessibility and

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.960
 all kinds of guidelines related to colors and everything that is there.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.440
 And I really like what you're doing and I would love to chat.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.160
 That's all.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.320
 >> Yeah, 100%, let's talk after, okay.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.840
 >> Yeah, right now we have- >> Further questions,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.320
 let me check behind my back, nope.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.600
 In the audience, someone there who could build a fax interface for

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.560
 the German government.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.760
 >> [LAUGH]

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.480
 >> Yeah, of course.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.120
 Yes, over there, give me a second.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:57.920
 >> And I wanted to ask the question after the last one.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.520
 You said that you are very active in the community and

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.720
 that you talk to people in protests that were mistreated by police.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.120
 >> Yeah. >> Is that most of the,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.440
 cuz that lets me ask the question, is there anybody else you can reach or

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.760
 is it mostly just the people directly in a community, directly there?

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.720
 Are you mostly working with the people that are in your communities or

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.040
 do you have ways to reach outside of those or

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.840
 maybe people that don't have any communities?

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.040
 >> Well, I wouldn't know how to reach people that have no communities.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.840
 [LAUGH]

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.400
 If they have, yeah, I mean, I've never thought about it like that.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.560
 Again, I can give you my personal experience.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.760
 So most of the police accountability work that I did as a lawyer,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.360
 like either working in volunteer organizations or

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.440
 litigating the police happened in a span of about three to four years.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.560
 And in that time, it took me about two to three years to get into the right networks.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.360
 And in these networks, let's say I'm working as a strategic litigation lawyer,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.760
 you'll be working with a community law center, and

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.400
 then you'll also be working with a police accountability organization.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.920
 Those two organizations will get community members, normally a youth member,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.520
 normally someone who's part of that community and has a political space in there.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.280
 And then you inform those community members of what you have and

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.600
 then they can distribute it if they'd like.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.400
 But I think if I see most of the downloads that I have for

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.360
 a lot of the applications I do are global.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.880
 So if you type in know your rights into the Play Store,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.760
 the police accountability app comes to the top.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.960
 But that's just for New Zealand.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.160
 So it's kind of like, you're right,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.280
 it's like getting to that community is definitely the hardest part.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.920
 But again, it's like you have to just be there.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:47.360
 >> All right, and with that, we are at the end of our time.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.400
 >> Awesome, thank you. >> Thank you very much.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.240
 So please give a very warm round of applause for Las Vilas.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.080
 Thank you very much.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.680
 >> Thank you.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.680
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.880
