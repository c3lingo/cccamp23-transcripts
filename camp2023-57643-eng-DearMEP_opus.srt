3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,920
 Now, it's my very great pleasure to give the word over for the talk,

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,000
 Dear MEP, Free Software Infrastructure for Online Campaigning in the EU.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,160
 And please give a hand of applause to our speakers.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,480
 >> [APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,600
 >> Thank you that you join us late at night.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,720
 We are very happy that we can do a little bit of an introduction and

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,920
 announcement to the free software that we are developing.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
 My name is Thomas Lohninger, I'm Executive Director of AP Center Works and

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
 the Boston Digital Rights Organization and also Vice President of EDGIE,

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,800
 the umbrella of almost all digital rights NGOs working in the European Union.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,480
 And I'm here joined today with Tim Weber.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,840
 >> Right, I'm Tim or Sky.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,640
 I don't have as many titles, I'm a freelance software developer.

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,520
 And I've been around this whole chaos family since 2005 or something like that.

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,020
 So yeah.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,200
 >> Great, yeah, let's get started.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,600
 There's a little bit of theoretical overview and then we will show you a preview.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,240
 And mind you that there is also access to the tool available for

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,920
 everyone here at camp.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,680
 The URL will be announced later and we also had handouts.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
 But first let's explain a little bit why we are here.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,320
 Can you turn to the next slide?

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,440
 Yeah, exactly.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,360
 So what's the theory of change?

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
 Why are we doing this?

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,120
 Our basic idea is that political decisions worsen when politicians are left alone.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,840
 Particularly with difficult things like internet regulation.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,080
 Technology regulation is inherently difficult.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
 And we believe that our community, that the hacker community,

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,240
 that people that are actually living in the internet have important things to say.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,040
 And that in today's world, particularly young people and

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,320
 people that are very much connected with the internet should be heard

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,920
 when politicians are making laws about technology and about the internet.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
 And our tool tries to bridge that divide.

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
 Our tool tries to connect citizens and

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
 average users with their political decision makers.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,160
 In our case, members of the European Parliament, MEPs, so those people that we

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,000
 elect every four years that sit in the European Parliament in Brussels and

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,240
 in Strasbourg and make these very important decisions.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,760
 And those 705 MEPs come from all countries of the EU.

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,400
 Those people are elected by us.

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
 They should be accountable to us.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 And in the way the European Union works, whenever a law is made,

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,720
 the parliamentarians have their say.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,880
 And there is a complex system between Brussels and Strasbourg and

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,320
 various committees where every law has to be voted on various stages until you have

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,280
 a final piece of text that is the official position of the European Parliament.

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,760
 And it doesn't matter if you go back to the softer patterns from the 90s or

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
 the GDPR or net neutrality copyright.

52
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,400
 It is always the case that we usually have our best chance to adhere to civil

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,480
 rights, to enshrine fundamental rights in the law with those 705

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,040
 members of European Parliament.

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,560
 Those are the people that we vote for, not some government officials from

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,880
 ministries, and that's why they are our best chance to have future proof

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,400
 legislation adopted for half a billion people in the biggest market in the world,

58
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
 which is the EU.

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,360
 And you know that the EU often sets global standards, so we really believe

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,800
 that we need to look closely for the quality of those decisions.

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,520
 And what we did in the past, in 2013-14, with safetyinternet.eu,

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,520
 was that we sent faxes to the members of the European Parliament.

63
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,320
 Back then, it was the beautiful case that when you send a fax to an MEP,

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,960
 they all have their office, they all have their staff, it's a physical office

65
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,880
 they have, and in there is a multifunctional printer.

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,400
 And when you send a fax to that printer, it gets printed out on paper.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
 And you cannot disconnect the fax without also disconnecting the printer.

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,480
 So we hacked that, basically, for net neutrality back then.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,320
 And so many trees were killed in the process.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
 I have to say.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,520
 But this was really efficient.

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,000
 I still remember the stories from liberal politicians,

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,960
 FDP from Germany, where the politician was really not our friend.

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
 But because every morning, he had a pile of paper on his desk

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,440
 from citizens that wanted to have their opinion heard by this politician.

76
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,640
 And the staffers really had this pile of paper every day,

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,560
 so they couldn't ignore the citizens' opinion.

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,720
 And that's also one of the reasons why we won Infrastreeding

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,200
 in the European Parliament for Net Neutrality.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,160
 And then we continued on.

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,720
 You all remember upload filters, Article 13 in the copyright directive.

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,400
 And back in 2019, we did a similar campaign.

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,880
 But because we were so successful with the faxes,

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,760
 faxes are no longer available in the printer.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
 They are now received in Outlook.

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,000
 That means they are also in the spam filter.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
 They are no longer a viable way to reach the politician.

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,560
 Telephone still is.

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,600
 And in a very hasty campaign in 2019, we actually developed a call tool

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
 where people could call their members of European Parliament,

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
 not just once, but also having a call subscription,

92
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,240
 where every day you would be connected to the same politician from your country.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,880
 And it was a way for us to really make a difference.

94
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,800
 Even allies of ours, like Marit De Schaake from the Liberal Dutch Party,

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,680
 D66, said that was really helpful, but never do it again.

96
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,400
 Because whenever we were in the office, the phone was ringing.

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,680
 And whenever you are done with that one citizen, the phone would ring again.

98
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,960
 So that was a very efficient way to reach parliamentarians in 2019.

99
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,000
 But sadly, that software was a really ugly piece of thing

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 that we just developed hastily.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
 And it's not usable.

102
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,000
 It was never open source because it wouldn't be something

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,120
 that's stable, usable for many campaigns.

104
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,000
 And that's why we created DRMEP.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,240
 The basic premise of this tool is that, yes, this will be disturbing.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,040
 Yes, politicians would rather prefer being left alone

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,200
 with their power without hearing from their constituency.

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,360
 But we believe it's time that they are accountable to their citizens

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
 and that they need to listen to the opinions from experts.

110
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
 And we all are experts here in the room.

111
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,160
 When it comes to technology, I think all of us have valuable things

112
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,320
 to contribute to this difficult problem of regulation of tech.

113
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,480
 And these tools that we are developing here are commonplace in the US.

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,920
 You have many tools that call Congress is one example.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,720
 In the UK, this is very common that you get connected with your member

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
 of parliament in the House of Commons.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,720
 In the EU, this is really not something that's done.

118
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,880
 And we would like to fill that gap.

119
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,640
 And one thing that we do here is not just to offer a phone tool

120
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,320
 that makes it very easy to connect with politicians.

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,440
 We are also focusing on the movable middle.

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,280
 In every political decision, there is a side that you've already won.

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
 Like, let's take chat control.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,800
 You don't need to convince Patrick Breyer from the pirate party.

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,680
 He is already on our side.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,600
 You will also never convince Axel Frost from the CDU, from the conservatives.

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,680
 What you have to focus on, if you really want to get a majority,

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,960
 is to focus on the movable middle, on those politicians that are yet left

129
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,640
 undecided, that can still be convinced with good arguments.

130
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,840
 If they hear from people in their own language that truly care

131
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,760
 about the issue they have to vote upon, we believe that focusing

132
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,920
 on that movable middle with giving people a voice is a great way

133
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,600
 to actually increase the quality of the laws that get adopted.

134
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,800
 And so to sum things up, what we try to solve with this tool

135
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,160
 is to really make it easy for users to engage with the EU.

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,640
 The EU is a difficult beast.

137
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,760
 There is process, there is trust books, there are 705 MEPs.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,320
 You really have a hard time trying to even get your opinion

139
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,680
 to the person that could theoretically vote on this.

140
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,040
 And so we try to abstract everything that concerns the EU machinery.

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,200
 You only need to care about the issue and make your own voice heard.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,720
 Of course, if you do international calls, they should usually be a cost.

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,040
 Particularly if you do this seriously, there could be roaming charges

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
 depending on the price of your mobile phone contract.

145
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,920
 That will not be the case with our tool, because we call the user.

146
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,320
 There is no cost at all for a citizen.

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,320
 We believe that we have an obligation as providers of this tool

148
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,040
 to really maximise the time that people are donating.

149
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,120
 The users are volunteers, they don't get paid for that.

150
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
 They care about something.

151
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,200
 And really making the most out of the 20, 15, 30 minutes a week

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
 that they want to contribute for an issue is our obligation.

153
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,200
 And that's why we try to maximise the impact from every phone call.

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,480
 As I said, don't call us, we call you.

155
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,640
 And most importantly, and that's the difference to the copyright campaign

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,920
 we did in 2019, this is a white label solution.

157
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,840
 So it will be usable for these rights campaigns, but also for climate,

158
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,120
 for migration issues, for any issue that people care about.

159
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,280
 And that's also why we released the software under a GPL license,

160
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,040
 because it's our belief that the path to parliament

161
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,320
 should be as long or as short for everybody.

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
 In a democracy, everybody should have equality

163
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
 when it comes to influencing politicians and decision makers.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,280
 And I think that's, yeah, there's also concept note.

165
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,760
 We haven't published this yet, but that's freely available

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,000
 for people that want to engage.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,560
 It gives a good outline of what we try to achieve,

168
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,200
 what also future development steps would be.

169
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,840
 But let's leave it at the theoretical level,

170
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,160
 and I would love to show you the demonstration

171
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,600
 of the tool that we already have.

172
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,280
 Right, yeah, so that's the demo.

173
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,360
 So this is where things can actually go wrong, right?

174
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,040
 So as you can see, I'll just...

175
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,480
 We have handouts for the people who are there.

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,000
 That's the URL, it's live right now.

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,080
 It's chatcontrol.dermep.eu.

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,360
 Just a small announcement, this is live and accessible for the camp right now.

179
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,080
 We will probably, like, password protect it later on at some point.

180
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,320
 So if you're watching a recording of this and you can't access the site,

181
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,400
 yeah, then it's over.

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,360
 So what you see here is basically the page you're seeing

183
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
 when you first open the tool.

184
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,400
 You can switch the language.

185
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,680
 So right now we have it available in German, English, and Swedish.

186
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,920
 And as I said, here's where things go wrong, right?

187
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,320
 Let me just refresh this real quick.

188
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,800
 Let's hope we have an internet connection here.

189
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,840
 Internet conferences are prone to weak internet connection.

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,040
 But the thing is, I have a local instance running as well,

191
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,000
 so I can just use that, right?

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
 OK, so yeah, you can switch the language,

193
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,720
 and also there's a geolocation built in.

194
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,280
 So whenever you access the site for the first time,

195
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,400
 it will detect which country you are coming from.

196
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,040
 This is all done without third-party services,

197
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,240
 so we really focus a lot on privacy here.

198
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,120
 So you can see there's a lot of countries in the EU,

199
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,760
 and I can simply say, OK, I'm from the Netherlands,

200
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,600
 and it will suggest a member of parliament from there to me.

201
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
 So this is basically what the system thinks that...

202
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,080
 or one of the persons that the system thinks

203
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,520
 that would be beneficial to call.

204
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,320
 If you don't like calling this particular person,

205
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
 you can always press this refresh button,

206
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,080
 and it will suggest someone different.

207
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,200
 But you can also say, if you like...

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,640
 You can also use the search function right now.

209
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,280
 If you just click it, it will show you every MEP from the Netherlands,

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,640
 but you can also search for your favorite politician

211
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
 or something like that.

212
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,640
 And just select that one.

213
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,200
 So we also have here a lot of social media profiles

214
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
 and other ways to contact these persons.

215
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
 Also, the phone numbers, for example,

216
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,080
 there's a calendar built in

217
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,360
 because they switch between Brussels and Strasbourg.

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
 So the system will always give you the right number

219
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
 for where they are right now.

220
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,040
 And, yeah, if I just have this person,

221
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,560
 I would...

222
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,640
 If I want to call Axel Forze right now,

223
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
 I could say, "Call now."

224
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
 So...

225
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,840
 And here we are at the point

226
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,480
 where you have to give us your phone number.

227
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,760
 That's the only piece of identification from you that we get.

228
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
 And, I mean, without your phone number, we can't connect you,

229
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,280
 so that's fair game, I think.

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,680
 So it just enters some kind of phone number.

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
 And I...

232
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,520
 Yes, I have read and accepted the privacy policy.

233
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,120
 By the way, we already have a working privacy policy

234
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
 if you're interested in that.

235
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
 And...

236
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
 So it's...

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,840
 I click it, it sends me a code on my mobile phone.

238
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,200
 "Oh, yeah, all right, my code is...

239
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,960
 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, of course."

240
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,840
 And...

241
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,200
 I verify this. So, yeah.

242
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,840
 We are now successfully verified with this number.

243
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,320
 And we can now start a call.

244
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,400
 So what would happen in this instance,

245
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
 not right now,

246
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 is that our phone would ring

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 and we would pick up the phone

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,520
 and some nice voice, maybe of Thomas or someone else,

249
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
 would say, "OK, hi, this is DRMEP.

250
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,440
 "Would you like to be connected to Axle Force?"

251
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
 And then you could, like, press 1 or 2 or something like that,

252
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,720
 and you would be connected to the office of Axle Force.

253
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,240
 So let's click Start Call,

254
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
 and we'll call you right away.

255
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,120
 And as you can see, there are talking points right here.

256
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,760
 So ignore this for a moment.

257
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,280
 This is just the mock-up.

258
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,480
 So this is already showing what you would see

259
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,200
 if the call were over.

260
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
 So we have a lot of talking points

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,840
 which you can scroll through during your call

262
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,960
 to aid you in...

263
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,600
 Yeah.

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,640
 In talking to the person.

265
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,000
 And after the call,

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,840
 you are able to give some feedback,

267
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,920
 like, "Were you able to convince the person?"

268
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,440
 Let's click Yes with Axle Force. Come on, let's say.

269
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,560
 Axle Force voted against...

270
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,840
 ..terminology, like, the thing that just reclassified

271
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
 "call power" as green.

272
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,520
 He was actually with Fridays for Future.

273
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,640
 So Axle Force is convincing on some issues.

274
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,480
 Let's not give hope up on it.

275
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,240
 And the beauty of that here is that, of course,

276
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,920
 the system is learning.

277
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,640
 If enough people have said,

278
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,280
 "Yeah, I have convinced this politician,"

279
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,120
 they will actually move to the green corner

280
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,400
 and be out of the movable middle.

281
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
 So the system is actually learning.

282
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
 You don't need to divide up with Axle Sheets,

283
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,160
 the members of parliament.

284
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,120
 Everybody can just use that tool.

285
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,440
 And you are always connected to the person

286
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,040
 who is most likely to be influenced,

287
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,120
 who can make a difference,

288
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,320
 and the system always learns

289
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,960
 from the users that are using it.

290
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,400
 Right. So you can give additional feedback

291
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
 if you want to, and we just click "Submit".

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,480
 So we're back on the page.

293
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,320
 We could instantly choose another person,

294
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,120
 and let's show us the second feature.

295
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,000
 We can also call later.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,840
 So what's "call later"?

297
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,000
 Call later allows you to enter a schedule.

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,360
 Maybe you're like, "OK, I have time each Tuesday

299
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,720
 at around, I don't know, 13.30 to talk to a politician,

300
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
 because that's right after my lunch break.

301
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,440
 I am in a good mood,

302
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,680
 and I would like to talk to a politician.

303
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,040
 And on Thursday, my lunch break is basically on 1 o'clock

304
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,160
 or something like that.

305
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,480
 So you can enter different times for different workdays,

306
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,080
 or you can just leave it like that,

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,160
 and you can say "Confirm", and basically that's it.

308
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,400
 So what would happen right now is the system would call you

309
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,240
 on Tuesday at 13.30 or around 13.30,

310
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,920
 and ask you, "Do you have time right now?

311
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,800
 Do you want to be connected to Berg Lars Patrik?"

312
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,040
 And yeah.

313
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,880
 And the reason for that is that we know that,

314
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
 particularly for nerds, maybe for everybody,

315
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,880
 speaking with foreign people is not easy.

316
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,120
 We know that this is a high ask, that actually picking up the phone,

317
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,360
 speaking with politicians is a big favour we're asking from people.

318
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,120
 But those people that are willing to do this once,

319
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,200
 most likely will do it again.

320
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,560
 And by maximising this slow conversion rate of those people

321
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,960
 that truly care, that we want to speak with their parliamentarian,

322
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
 and letting them do it again, maybe get really good at it,

323
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 that's also a beauty of this talk.

324
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,560
 Again, we are nudging people, whenever we call you,

325
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,440
 there will be the option "Press 9" and the subscription is cancelled.

326
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,920
 And as I said, there's a privacy policy already in place,

327
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,000
 the GDPR compliant, yes, we adhere to the law,

328
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,720
 and we are very strict with the data that we process.

329
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,640
 Most phone numbers are hashed and encrypted,

330
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,240
 only in active call subscriptions where we need the number to connect to,

331
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,560
 then we have it actually in the database.

332
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,640
 But we try to be as privacy preserving and minimalistic as possible with all of that.

333
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,240
 And as we are out of time, I'd just briefly like to say before I go to Q&A,

334
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,200
 that this tool right now will be applied for the chat control campaign,

335
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,680
 we are still in development, we are also here to talk with the community,

336
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,200
 to get your feedback and your input, maybe also get some help

337
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,080
 with testing, penetration testing, development and so forth.

338
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,040
 But at this stage, it's really something that we, after chat control has passed,

339
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,720
 hope to release in this HPPL license, that we have something that's forever truly available

340
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,960
 for the community to engage with MVPs.

341
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,520
 Thank you.

342
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:51,840
 Thank you so much for your talk.

343
00:19:51,840 --> 00:20:04,240
 So, we have decided beforehand that you are going to do the Q&A offline outside of the tent,

344
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,080
 because we are out of time here for this stage,

345
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,280
 but these two speakers will still be available for your questions,

346
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:23,960
 just we won't be using our kind angel team back there for the technology there.

347
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,680
 So, thank you all for coming here.

348
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,880
 Please give another round of applause to our speakers.
