2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Eileen is presenting to us Decent Patterns and UX Library for Decentralization.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Welcome.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Thank you so much.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 After that last lightning talk, I feel like I'm being very greedy with 20 minutes, but

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 maybe we'll just have more time for questions.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 So I'm here to talk about Decent Patterns and Open UX Library for Decentralization.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 This is a project that I guess I started a few years ago with a small team of co-conspirators,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 some of whom are all at this camp actually, so you can meet us too and talk more about

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 this.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'm hoping this talk will be interesting to those of you who are building decentralized

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 technologies, but of course also people who are generally just knowledge workers, right?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Like if you have done a library in your life, maybe you'll run into some similar questions

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 that I'm going to raise today.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Similarly, I think it's an interesting answer to the question, what can designers contribute

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 in open source?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 This is something that I've been thinking about for a long time.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So I think maybe there are some answers here.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 But why?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Why build one in the first place?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So I'm a designer.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I work in decentralization technologies around that.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And whenever I work with people, you know how it is.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You go into a small team, you work with them intensely for a few months, and then you go

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 to another team, and you go to an organization, and then maybe you get a chance to build a

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 team, and you go to an organization, and then maybe you get a chance to talk to another

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 designer, but basically you're kind of alone.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But as I was working alone with all of these groups, there were just some recurring questions

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 that everybody had, right?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 How to permanently delete content.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 This is a very, very common question if you're working P2P.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 How to store encryption keys.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Where to store them if you have multiple devices and you have no central authority.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 How to ensure a critical number of peers being online, right?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That's so that the content can be replicated.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 How do you communicate the unusual privacy and security properties of your new technologies?

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 How do you even explain a federated architecture?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I think we saw a lot of that with the migration to Mastodon of how to do it and how not to do it.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And then finally, overall, very abstract questions.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 How do you even distribute trust and power?

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 What is the right way to do it?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I see all of these teams struggling with that.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And as I was working on it, I was like, surely someone thought about this.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Surely someone has come up with a general solution to these very general problems.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And I was just, no.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Sitting there, I was like, nope.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Nobody has really written bigger pieces of solutions to these problems.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And more than that, it wasn't just that I couldn't find those resources that I needed for my work,

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 but it was also somewhat of a general adoption problem.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Well, UX problems that caused adoption problems.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And by that I mean most of us who are building these technologies, decentralized or not,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 we're seeing that as a vehicle to drive or at least support sociopolitical change.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And for sociopolitical change to happen, you really have to have a critical mass of people using it.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It doesn't mean it has to be the whole world, but it means a critical mass of users need to be using this tool.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And adoption also is actually very well understood.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Products and services get adopted by some very common systems.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 People are enthused about it, and then some people are visionaries, they see it,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 and then finally the pragmatists, the conservatives and the skeptics follow.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 But that curve is very well understood.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And as I was working with the folks, I realized that we really never move much further beyond the first group of people,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 the people who want to try out everything, who want to show you a proof of concept,

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 and who are really excited about it.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But there was very little movement forward.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And in my view, one of the reasons for that is when you have new technologies like this,

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 you don't have a common framework you can build into.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 When you have new concepts and everybody names it differently,

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 every user, new user who has to learn this, has to learn a completely new framework, this is super hard.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So in my view, when I was thinking about adoption, I was really thinking about something like design standards.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 What would a good standard be as you are building this new technology?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And by standards, I don't mean generic guidelines like always give people good error messages when you build a tool,

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 not generic things like that, but also not super specific things like Apple's mobile interface guidelines or anything like that.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Somewhere in the middle. What was that middle?

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And then I realized actually that middle is also very well understood.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 This is what I had to do to sign up for this talk.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You go to this website, either you have an account already, then you log in, or you don't have an account and you need one, then you register.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I see another pattern there, reset password, right? You lost your password, you reset the password.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 There is a language switch, I don't know if you can see it on the top right.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 On the bottom you have the legal bits, right?

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 All of this is something that is familiar to us just as users on the Internet.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 It is something we see day in and day out.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 We are trained to sort of understand how that user experience is supposed to be.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And in that way we are sort of learning a language, learning a language of how to interact with these technologies.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And this idea of having a language is also not new.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 This is a book by Christopher Alexander, 1979, A Timeless Way of Building.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It really details this idea of how you can see different patterns in the world.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Christopher Alexander was an architect.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He was meticulously documenting different ways of looking at buildings, urban infrastructure, small room, like window placement.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And he defined this idea of a pattern as a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So again, buildings, right?

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 People have lived in buildings for thousands of years.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 You don't need to reinvent the wheel when you are doing a new building.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You just look at existing buildings.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And this is what he was doing as he was sort of collecting these patterns.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And this is just one example for sort of urban planning.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 These are the typical ways of how you can put buildings together.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Like a very simple idea.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He's just going around collecting different ways of putting buildings together.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So what I and the small team I'm working with wanted to do was to just sort of collect these things and see how we are putting our language together, how we could put our language together.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And with that, I just want to show you really the thing that we built.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 This is decentpatterns.com.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 It's a pattern library, meaning that we have different categories and different patterns sort of explained to a general audience.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 The first thing we had to come up with was a template for a pattern.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So I'm just going to show you really.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 This is a pattern we called host roulette.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Of course, the name is the most important thing because that is the thing that explains it and people can refer to it.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So host roulette is addressing a design problem.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The design problem is when you are signing people onto a federated system, you want to give people default options.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 That's just good UX.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But if you give everybody the same default option, it's not much of a federated system anymore.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So host roulette, very simple solution.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 You randomize it.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You're putting the host on a roulette.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Get it?

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So basically what you're doing is you're randomizing the signup process and you can achieve better distribution of your users.

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So we describe the solution and then give an example of who's already doing this.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 In this case, this is Nextcloud.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Again, this is a short one, but why choose host roulette, understanding what reasons you would have to actually use such a pattern.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Then we have best practice.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 These are just tips from the actual practice of implementing these patterns.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 A small discussion, potential problems with a pattern.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 A takeaway and then some references where you can learn more.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So this is the general template that we have for a pattern.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Importantly here, I think we also have the option for you to just edit it on GitHub.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So you can always just join the actual GitHub and see what you might want to change, what's inaccurate, what you might want to add.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 The other thing that we did, which I think is also part of running a knowledge base, is we did name categories.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 We basically identified even more kind of overall topics that are interesting here in decentralization.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 We think those are sort of around roughly four different categories where it's different from centralized paradigms.

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And that's identity and agency, moderation and curation, sharing and permissions, and sync and status.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I'm not going to go into detail on why they're important, but I think for any of you who have worked in decentralization, hopefully those categories ring true.

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Yeah, I think this is just my very quick demo of the library.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You can play around in it.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 There's also, you can just look at all the patterns if you want to see them all.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Again, the most important part here may be the naming of it, and then the other things just sort of come themselves.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You'll see that there are many, there are very different levels of kind of, yeah, genera, well, generality here.

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Like some of them are very specific, like a visual idea, but some of them are, I don't know, I'm looking at cautious optimism.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 That is an idea of how to even build a protocol, like how to think about trust in a protocol, things like that.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 So we really have sort of like very large ideas and very small ideas all collected in this one pattern library.

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Next I want to talk a little bit about like, okay, so what have we learned in doing this?

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I think one thing that was really interesting for me to see is when we first started it, we were very happy about putting QR code verification in it.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 It was a very immediate way for devices to connect and to verify.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It had great security properties. It was just very immediate.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And then the pandemic happened and QR codes were everywhere, right?

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 All the different apps that you had introduced QR codes, it just really sort of accelerated that development.

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And then you see things like this. I don't know if the video is going to be very much visible,

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 but this person is in Atlanta and is just peeling off the QR code from a parking ticket provider, I suppose.

147
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And that's what happens, right?

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Like once you have an idea that is out there in the world and people learn to use it, like it's actually first of all, what a success story for QR codes.

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 But also here are the caveats, here are the consequences that come with that.

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So how do we make sure that the patterns we do have, you know, I mean, I'm not saying we have to see so far into the future,

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 but what kind of critical discussion, what kind of context can we actually provide people with who are using this in their actual development?

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 The other thing we sort of ran into is a question around descriptive versus prescriptive ways of presenting the patterns.

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And by that I just mean descriptive as a, you know, it's a description or just showing you the actual patterns.

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Prescriptive is there is some recommendation coming with it, right?

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So in a descriptive sense we have collecting existing solutions and relating them to one another.

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 So the work that you do there is mostly just finding the right level of abstraction and making sure that the patterns you have in a library are described correctly.

157
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And you're to inspire, you're there to inspire people, you're not more.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 In a prescriptive world we have a library that perhaps creates new solutions to these problems, so you really are generating new content.

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Maybe you're testing and validating them with, you know, real users in the real world,

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and you're making sure that whatever you build is actually going to work and not just hypothetical.

161
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 In that case then the library is there to guide people, to really offer some guidance and recommendations.

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So we're still sort of unclear about that.

163
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Right now it's a collection and we do think most of the patterns we have are good, but that's just our opinion, right?

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And we know as designers that a lot of the things we design aren't necessarily good until we test them.

165
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So that's it from me. You can check out decentpatterns.com.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 We obviously welcome contributions and also shout out to the team raised there.

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 We have Vincent and Knop also.

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And if you're interested in pattern libraries in general you should also check out, I mean, there are general libraries that you can just go to that have UX patterns.

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 If you're a designer and trying to learn how to design.

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But there's also particular libraries I really would recommend for privacy security, for social media.

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 There's one about digital public spaces being made right now.

172
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Of course there's also anti-patterns you should think about, patterns that are deceptive.

173
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Those are all great libraries that you should check out just if you're into patterns in general.

174
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And that's it. I would love to answer your questions. Thank you.

175
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 [Applause]

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Okay. Thank you Eileen.

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Applause are fine but I thought maybe we take the time for questions.

178
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 We have time for two because we're a bit behind schedule.

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 What are your questions to Eileen?

180
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Does somebody have a question?

181
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I have a small question. I'm really curious about UX/UI.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I wanted to know if I wanted to know more because you gave me a lot of links.

183
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I wanted to know more about it, where I could look into it, about what's new.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Because what you did is already edge.

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But I'm really curious about the world field because as a developer it's really interesting for me.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Yeah. I think, I mean, so those are good links to look if you're into patterns.

187
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I think it's always difficult to think about how patterns fit into the development process

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 because it's very abstract and sometimes you do need a designer to help you actually put the pixels in place.

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It's a bit of a different type of work.

190
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But if you're interested in UX/UI in general, they're awesome resources.

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The one that I like a lot is the Interaction Design Foundation.

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 They have a lot of really good courses and it's like a foundation in Denmark that just sort of does good work

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 and it's sort of very classic and well presented, I think.

194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 We have time for one more question.

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Anyone?

196
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Okay. Then I'll say thank you, Eileen, again.

197
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Go talk to Eileen if you have other questions.

198
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It was nice to have you.

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
