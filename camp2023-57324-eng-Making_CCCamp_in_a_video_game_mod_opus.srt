3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 So essentially, I'm here to talk today about a game that I'm working on called Off Grid.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'll give you a bit of an overview of its development history so far.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Some of you may have heard of it because Rich Smithson, who's making Off Grid,

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 is always heavily involved with this event and Millie Waze.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I want to go through a few of the hacking and social engineering mechanics in our game

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and also talk to you about what the talk is about, the modding that we're doing,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 and how on Friday you can come and join me in a workshop and we can put you inside the game.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So who is this bozo? This is me, I'm Steph Keegan.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I'm an artist, writer, developer.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I've been working in the film industry and the games industry for several years.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I've been working mostly in VR for the last decade.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 If any of you are VR fans out there, you may have heard of some of the things I've worked on,

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 the Pixel Ripped and Winlands.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And if you have played Winlands 2, you also might recognise my voice because that's me.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I'm Sorala.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It sort of tends to happen in indie games when you run out of budgets.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 The developers end up being the characters.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Earlier this year, I joined the company Samaeopus, who are making Off Grid.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I just wanted to give you all a warning that I know very little about code.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'm not a coder, I'm an artist.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And that will become imminently clear when I try to talk about more technical stuff in this talk.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Yeah, that's me.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So, Samaeopus is very hard to spell.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'm always getting it wrong.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It's an indie game studio founded by Rich Metzen and Pointers Schoenberg.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Two very lovely guys, and sadly aren't here today, and they really wish they were.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 They want to make games that matter.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So essentially, further the maturity of the medium and have something to say.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And at a talk, at another hacking conference years ago, Rich saw a talk that inspired him to make this game.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And they've been working Off Grid for roughly ten years, as is the way sometimes when you're trying to support yourself as an indie development team

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 and don't want to take money from the man, you have to support yourself.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So we're still going though.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Anyone who may have backed us on Kickstarter, don't worry.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's still happening. We're still squirrelling away.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And for those of you who don't know, here is a quick trailer.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 [no audio]

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 [no audio]

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Okay.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 [no audio]

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Okay, so what is Off Grid?

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 It's a moddable stealth hacking game.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And it's not going to be, it's not broad, it's made by people who really care about the industry and know what they're talking about.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And so there are themes of net neutrality, privacy, digital rights.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 But it's also made by British developers with a British sense of humour, so it's quite tongue in cheek and satirical.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 It's set in the not too distant Orwellian future.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Or at least it was when we began making it 13 years ago, but it seems like it's just set in reality now, unfortunately.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And a bit of an overview, as you play as this character Joe, he's kind of a technophobe.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 He doesn't know anything. He's basically me.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But he's sort of pulled into this world unexpectedly when his daughter, Jen, is arrested.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 She's been involved in something, some sort of secretive hacking thing, fighting the man.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And their house is raided in the first, say, level introduction.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And suddenly Joe is thrust into this world and he doesn't know anything about it.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But he is led by a mysterious stranger called Smedley, who is a hacker friend of Jen's.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And with the help of Smedley, you begin to try and unravel what is going on.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So yes, in 2013, when - I'm going to say we, even though I wasn't involved back then, but it's just easier.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 When we began thinking about it, we wanted it to be grounded for impact.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 We wanted to make jokes and laugh, but we wanted it to matter.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So it was really important to us not to be alienating or confusing.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And so we were worried that our lore would be too heightened.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 We're games developers, so we wanted to do weird things and exaggerate the tech and the things.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And back in 2013, some of our ideas seemed a bit out there.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We scaled back on some of our network and surveillance tech because they seemed too unrealistic.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And we really wanted to make mundane household objects hackable.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And some of them were ridiculous and in the end we were like, we can't put that in.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 No one would believe it.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now, a lot has changed.

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 The real world is actually outpacing our fiction, which is depressing, but great for us as devs.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Sorry, that's my fault, I'm wobbling around.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Ideas that we rejected for being too out there have now got back into the game.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Nothing ever stays on the clipping floor.

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Yeah, we had to actually make the network and surveillance tools more pervasive for it to become more realistic.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So that was interesting.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And as for mundane objects on Wi-Fi, this is a cat toilet.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 What really bothers me about this picture is this woman is not only watching her cat poop.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 She's monitoring on the Wi-Fi at the same time.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 What is that doing that your eyes aren't?

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Yeah, I actually own that toilet.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Please don't hack my cat toilet.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So the conception of the game is that it would be a game about data privacy.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So inevitably mechanics are covering things like hiding, cloaking, covering your tracks, that kind of stuff.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So it naturally fell into a stealth genre kind of game.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 But Rich and Pontus were keen to make it original and do their own thing.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So they wanted to kind of merge it and mesh it with a twist on the hacking genre.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And the way they've done that is they treat data like a tangible thing in the game.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So it's like a breadcrumb trail which you can pick up.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And I don't know if you can see that, but you have these kind of like Google glasses that can scan networks and you can see the data around you.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So essentially as you play the game, the main goals are to get physical access to the building.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 You kind of want to scan for data and you use that to crackle social engineering to access networks.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But also you want to be careful how much you do that. You don't want to be discovered on the network.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And there's much more in depth, like Rich would tell you a lot more in detail about it, but I'm just going to give you a brief overview.

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 So my favorite thing about it actually is the NPCs.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 So they built this NPC system and the NPCs are kind of driven by an AI that is goal oriented.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And so when you build an NPC, and that's what we're doing at my talk on Friday, is building you with NPCs, is you create a character profile for the NPC.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And there will be things like they like, things they dislike, their favorite song, their kind of personality type.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And with that information, as you scan and build up a much more detailed profile on them, it will help you do things like distract them better or brute force their passwords.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And in this picture is the guard is sleeping and the character Joe is scanning him for information, which he can then use to manipulate him later.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Or you can just prank them. So yeah, you can distract them, send them somewhere, you know, like the whole "what was that?" kind of vibe.

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And things like sending black facts to keep a secretary busy or that kind of stuff. So that's quite fun.

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We've built a bunch of tools and devices that you can hack, but the software is open and moddable.

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So we encourage people to come up with any weird and wacky ideas they have.

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And there is no one way to solve a level. So you'll be able to figure out your own fun ways to distract these NPCs to get what you want.

104
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Yeah, so you can hack vending machines, send black facts and mess with monitors.

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Basically anything technical is hackable, which we thought was pushing our luck back in 2013 and now we're just making everything hackable.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Yeah, so I'm just going to check my time. Okay, we're doing good.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So the modding tools. This is some old footage of the sort of level kit we're building.

108
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yeah, this is some of the art inside the game. But we make it in Unity.

109
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So when you do, obviously we are releasing the game as an individual game that we're making.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 But the modding tools and the level kit is really open and it's built in Unity.

111
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So if you wanted to build your own levels, you would use Unity.

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And it was really important to us and in the ethos of everything about the game is that we don't have any special magic tools that we don't give you.

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 You know, normally in modding games the developers can do all these extra wonderful things because they have a whole team and those secret databases of their own stuff.

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 But we don't want to do that. And it can be frustrating for me as an artist because I want to do things and they say,

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "Yeah, we can do that, but we're going to have to build a whole system so that the modders can do it too."

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 It's always the answer. So yeah, if I make a level, you'll be able to make the exact same level, essentially.

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Using like Lua API and tools for scripting, you can create your own character purpose, as I mentioned.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 You can build interactive objects. And even having conversations with people via text message in the game.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 We have all these different modules you can use to build complex scenes.

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And we do envision that you will make really better scenes than us and better games than us.

121
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 We're kind of excited to see what happens.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And you can use my art, and there's been several excellent artists before me.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Or you can import your own. There is no limit to what you do.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And you can script your own tools. The Google Glasses that the character wears has a bunch of tools for scanning networks

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 and all sorts of interesting things that Pontus and Rich have come up with.

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And we also have a ton we want to do.

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 But there's no stopping you from developing your own tool in the game and scripting your own hacking tools.

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And just as an example, as a story, this story is called Fosterage.

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 It was made in a mod by Yuri Martino, a very sweet man.

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And he told this story about a boy who was fostered, finds out that he's adopted.

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And it's just an example. You don't even have to set your mods in our world. You can do what you want.

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And Lua is user-friendly, which is great.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And we're building a wiki that needs constant updating, as you all know.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And hopefully we'll get more people updating it in the long run.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 But essentially it's all there. Like tomorrow I could give you everything you needed and you would be able to build a level.

136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And even me, a total dumb dumb artist, can do it.

137
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And like I said before, I didn't know any code at the beginning of the year.

138
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And now I'm writing Lua scripts so that I can make my characters do all sorts of things and run timeline animations.

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And yeah, it's great.

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And so what this talk is about is Mealyways.

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So, McFly, as many of you probably know, I'm sure most of you know who McFly is.

142
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He actually and a bunch of people built in 2019 Mealyways inside our mod of all stuff.

143
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And it was really cool.

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 There'll be things you recognise in here, like the Mealyways flags and the dome.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And there's a rocket in here somewhere. I think you can see it very much in the distance of this picture.

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 There's a rocket, tiny rocket on the screen.

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And so what they did is they built their own wiki page and sort of shared out the tasks to build all the art assets and took them up.

148
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And then they made their own version of Mealyways in the mod and put themselves in it.

149
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And if any of you know McFly online, you'll recognise his profile picture, you know, that 2D, that profile picture he uses, is actually his character in here.

150
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And there's a lot we can add.

151
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Obviously, things have changed. There's new things around.

152
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 We never really finished the scene.

153
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So we're encouraging people to come on Friday and to add to the mod.

154
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 You can build assets.

155
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Or there's updates 2023. There's things we don't have.

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We don't have you, so we can put you in it.

157
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And we encourage other villages to get involved.

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And, yeah, there's no limit, really. Come along and see what we can do.

159
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And these are the times that I will be running the workshops on Friday.

160
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 So essentially, yeah, you'll come and put yourself in the video game at 2.30 to 4.30 and 5 to 7.

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And it's going to be in the workshop dome, which I believe is there somewhere.

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And I've talked really fast because I was nervous about time.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So I have loads of time for questions. Who has questions?

164
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 [Applause]

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The talk. So thank you very much for the talk.

166
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 You already had applause. This is nice.

167
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But you can give a new round while you are thinking about if you have any questions.

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 If you have any questions, please line up at the microphone in the middle there.

169
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 If anyone wants to know something about the game or the workshop.

170
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Oh, you have a question.

171
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 When is going to be released? Because I see it say coming soon.

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Oh, I was hoping someone would ask that because I meant to bring that up.

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So, yeah, it has been saying coming soon for a long time.

174
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's actually been saying coming out in 2019 for a long time as well, which it hasn't.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 That's a very good question. So essentially, as is the way, it's been --

176
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 it did go on for a little while while we tried to keep afloat as a company

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 and did a lot of work just to build up money for ourselves and keep afloat.

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But what's really been great this year is we've kicked up a gear again.

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Especially one of the reasons I joined the team is to have a full-time artist working on it.

180
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 We're building levels now.

181
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Pontus is working really hard on developing tools and vent crawling mechanics and that kind of stuff.

182
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So I don't have an exact date for you, but progress is happening.

183
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I would like to see it within a year.

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But I couldn't tell you for sure at the moment. But it is -- progress is happening.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Okay. Thank you. Are there any more questions?

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 No. So if you are thinking of some questions, she will be here and giving workshops as well.

187
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And she will be able to answer all your questions.

188
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Then thank you very much for this interesting talk and the overview of the game.

189
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And give one last round of applause, please. Thank you.
