00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,920
 Now I'm really, really happy to announce Julian.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,520
 Julian is going to talk about biohack spaces and

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,120
 is going to share their knowledge on them with us.

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,600
 So please give a warm welcome, big applause to Julian.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,960
 >> [APPLAUSE]

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,480
 >> Hi, okay.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,680
 That went faster than I thought.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,040
 Hi, I'm going to talk about biohack spaces.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,240
 This might be a little rushed because originally I had much more time in mind

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,120
 when I applied for the talk.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,320
 I'm going to quickly tell you who I am.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,960
 I'm going to give you a very brief, like 120 seconds history of

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,920
 how the hackerspace movement got its traction 16 years ago.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
 And then I'm going to go into biohack labs,

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,640
 especially in the curious community labs, which I am a part of.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,440
 Talk a little about our projects.

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,360
 And then I'm gonna tell you why this is all important and very dear to my heart.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,920
 Who am I?

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,840
 I'm Julian.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
 Today I like to use they and then pronouns.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
 I'm 42, but I really don't have any answers for you.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,600
 I live in Hamburg and I'm part of the Curious Community Labs, which we founded

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,760
 in 2020 out of a group of people who had been doing DIY biology before.

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,800
 And I've also been part of the CCC for 20 years this year.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,520
 History of hackerspaces, and

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,720
 I think this is sort of important to know your roots.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 In 2007, who of you has been, went to the camp in 2007, or

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
 who of you has been around in 2007?

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 In 2007, there was an inflection point because

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,160
 there was, after the camp of 2007, there was a tour of European hackerspaces.

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,520
 And a bunch of American hackers, most notably Dan Kaminsky,

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,600
 we all dearly miss him, Nick Farr, Bree Petters, Mitch Altman,

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,360
 a couple of others, did a tour around European hackerspaces and

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
 visited the C-Base, MetaLab in Vienna, and Tropia in Karlsruhe,

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
 Chaos Computer Club in Cologne, which was sort of the biggest and

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,880
 most notable hackspaces around at that time.

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,200
 And Joel and Poulon did a talk about hackspace blueprints.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,920
 And out of that came a whole explosion of hackspaces.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,600
 After that, NYC Resistor was founded in New York,

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,800
 a noise bridge in San Francisco, and just, I don't know,

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,080
 about 50 different hackspaces within the next 18 months.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,120
 So this entire explosion of hackspaces and

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,640
 everything that has trickled down from there is sort of due to the camp in 2007

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,960
 somehow, and due to these people I would like to give a shout out.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,760
 And also a shout out to the original sort of European hackspaces like C-Base and

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,120
 MetaLab and Tropia, C4, and obviously don't forget the roots in the US as well,

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,800
 like Loft and others.

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
 The world is very different today.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,800
 The whole entire movement has changed, hackerspaces have changed, but this is,

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 I think it's quite important to know your roots and also understand that

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,840
 small inflection points really can start a movement and can inspire others and so on.

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:50,800
 I, after about 17 years in the hacker community in 2020,

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,200
 started being very interested in growing my own mushrooms.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,760
 And out of that sort of started joining the biopunk movement,

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,000
 which I'm going to quickly sort of give you an overview of what I mean when I say

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,480
 that we very much about DIY grassroots biology, and

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,200
 I understand that grassroots is a really funny word here.

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,960
 We are very diverse and not entirely definable.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,600
 And just as you can't really grasp what nature actually is,

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,000
 there's people doing stuff with DNA, there's people growing mushrooms,

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
 there's people going foraging, picking stuff, fermenting,

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,480
 playing with yeasts, inventing new foods, everything around that.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,520
 Very diverse, there's all sorts of projects all around Europe,

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,600
 but very few actual dedicated biohack spaces.

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
 We are curious about biology, we're curious about open source and sharing and

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,880
 teaching and learning just as well as the electronics and computer based hack scene.

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,440
 Some of us focus more on fungi, others on microbiology.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,480
 In Hamburg, we're very sort of fungi-focused group, but

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
 we also do a couple of other things.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,880
 And we're sort of separate from what someone might understand as the sort of

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,800
 old school biohacker body modification kind of scene.

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,360
 People who work with their own body and try to optimize, and

75
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,800
 so it's not really the same kind of people in any sense.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
 What we are more closely to is sort of the solar punk movement,

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,240
 people are thinking about being autonomous, going off grid.

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,800
 These kind of people, and then obviously we are sort of intertwined with the hacker

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,560
 movement as well.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,760
 In Hamburg, we founded the Curious Community Labs, we have 42 square meters.

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 We have some extra areas, it's all in the Oberhafen in Hamburg.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,480
 If you ever come by, please have a look at us.

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
 If you live in Hamburg, please come visit.

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,720
 We have 23 members, and those numbers aren't made up, neither the 42 nor the 23.

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,320
 And we have a bunch of gear standing around that we can use to do our own

86
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
 DIY biology.

87
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,200
 Some is very new, some is sort of foraged from industry,

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,160
 from companies throwing out old hardware, and we give it a new life.

89
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,480
 We grow mushrooms with a Flowhood, which is a sterile workbench.

90
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,920
 We have a big massive autoclave, we have grow tents.

91
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,480
 We have, someone sponsored us some DNA sequencing hardware.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,920
 We got a big grant to build the Garden of the Future,

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,080
 which has a massive weather station and a greenhouse.

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,400
 And we're certainly not the only biohack space around, but it's sort of hard to

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,840
 grasp, and there's not really this sort of website collecting everything,

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,760
 like there's on hackspaces.org.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 So if you are part of your own biohack space, please contact me afterwards,

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,520
 I'm happy to network.

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,280
 There's a bunch of people around Berlin as well.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
 There's obviously online, there's a couple of groups and

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,800
 people being interested in different topics.

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,320
 Our lab looks a little like this.

103
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,600
 There's also a bunch of equipment standing around that and

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,000
 stuff that you can't see because it's sort of distributed.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,960
 And we have a bunch of projects.

106
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,960
 Currently, most prominent is the Stadtpilze, or city mushrooms,

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,720
 which got sponsored by the city of Hamburg.

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,320
 We do some mushroom lamps, we build the Garden of the Future,

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
 as I just said.

110
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,880
 We go on foraging trips, we do food experiments and

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,600
 experiment with all sorts of new ideas of ways of fermenting things and

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,080
 growing yeasts and inventing new ways of doing things with

113
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,000
 combining mycelium with grains.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,320
 And then we also have people who build a little company building

115
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,880
 acoustic absorbing mycelium based composite materials and so on and so on.

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,080
 So it's very diverse, and I really have to rush through there a little,

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,560
 because I'm going to end the project a little more in depth now.

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,320
 The Stadtpilze is basically idea of taking a bucket that you can get at

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,440
 any restaurant you like, because they throw them out.

120
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,680
 Filling it with cardboard, with coffee grounds,

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,200
 with different other substrates, straw, and so on and so on.

122
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,280
 And we built this whole brochure that makes it very accessible for

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
 people to grow their own mushrooms.

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,080
 And this looks like, come on, this.

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,120
 Which is a pink oyster mushroom, which you can then grow yourself

126
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,840
 on your windowsill and eat, and it's very delicious.

127
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,560
 So being sustainable about your own food is sort of one part of what motivates us.

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,440
 Then we work with novel mycelium based materials, most notably the mushroom lamp

129
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:45,160
 which Matti built, which is a, and I'll show you how this stuff is made in a second,

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,040
 but it's basically, it feels a little like polystyrene.

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,160
 It has sort of a light weight, but it's very firm, and you can use it.

132
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:03,040
 It's 100% biodegradable, and it is built out of straw and buckwheat and mycelium.

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
 And then this becomes a lampshade.

134
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
 We grow mushrooms.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,560
 We have our own grow tent, which looks about a little like this.

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,200
 And we do this in a sterile work environment, so you need a flow hood or

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
 some other way of keeping your environment sterile.

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,040
 This puts pressured air through a HEPA filter, so

139
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:31,520
 you disinfect obviously, but that allows you to keep the stuff clean.

140
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,440
 I don't know if Sebastian is around?

141
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,680
 No? Okay.

142
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,720
 Sebastian has the project with building a planktoscope,

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,960
 which is a high speed photography plankton analyzing water and

144
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,920
 seeing what lives in there, and with raspberry pie and some high speed photography.

145
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,320
 I think 8,000 pictures per second, and then you can see what flows through there and

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,800
 what is actually in there, and count what is in there.

147
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
 We have group activities.

148
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,960
 We go out and forage mushrooms and prepare them and also learn about them,

149
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,840
 understand how to identify them, etc., etc.

150
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,880
 We go out into nature, which I know for some might be scary, but

151
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,400
 we actually love to do this kind of stuff.

152
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,520
 And then I'm going to talk a little about my own little project to

153
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
 illustrate a little more what can be done, and

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,480
 also because I know the most about what I do myself.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,880
 So last year I started playing the trumpet again,

156
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,400
 which had been a hobby when I was like a child.

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,240
 And then I stopped and then I started playing again, and

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,360
 I live in the middle of the city.

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,320
 So obviously my neighbors are not too happy about this.

160
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
 Now, you can buy mutes and stick them in the trumpet, but

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,920
 they restrict the airflow and that's sort of not really fun.

162
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,840
 Or you can buy these things for about 500 euros, which is sort of a barrel

163
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,720
 with some sound insulation, and you play inside and it's quiet and

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,960
 nobody gets disturbed and it's quite nice, but it's also 500 euros.

165
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,960
 And these things are made of plastic and not entirely great.

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,400
 However, I still bought one because I needed one urgently.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,800
 And then I thought, well, I think I can make this myself.

168
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,160
 So act one, I got myself a metal barrel and cut off the top.

169
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:24,000
 Act two is that I 3D printed a mold that I could use to create

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
 the waveform that reflects sound.

171
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,080
 Act three is that I grew a bunch of mycelium.

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,880
 And the way you do this is you take some carbohydrates like rye,

173
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,720
 you sterilize it, you inject some liquid mycelium or spores in there.

174
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,080
 You let it grow under good conditions and

175
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,560
 then you mix it up with some substrate.

176
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,280
 For example, in my case, I used rapeseed straw and

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,120
 I used buckwheat shells and I mixed them in a two to one relation and

178
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,200
 mixed it all up with mycelium and then I used reishi mushroom,

179
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
 which is a medicinal mushroom.

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
 But it also has incredible propagating properties,

181
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
 like this stuff grows like crazy and

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,920
 it's very hard to get any molding or rotting in there.

183
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,960
 So I used that and then I shredded it all and ran it through a clean shredder.

184
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,480
 And then I placed it all together and

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
 placed it all together and let it grow for about a week.

186
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,520
 And then I had this and then I took out the mold and then I dried it and

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,720
 now I can play my trumpet into this and it is 100% compostable.

188
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,560
 It is completely DIY and it also keeps my neighbors from complaining.

189
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,360
 So that is what I built this winter.

190
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,040
 So you can have a lot of fun and there's a million of applications of growing your

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,320
 own mushrooms, of understanding nature around you, building your own food,

192
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 working with different kinds of components.

193
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,840
 Also building tools and software and

194
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,680
 hardware to help to make this even easier and

195
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,320
 create less, what do you call it,

196
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,040
 you don't have to throw that much away, for example.

197
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,240
 Or understanding more about the strains you're building,

198
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,000
 and microscopic stuff, organizing the different samples, etc, etc.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 So there's a bunch of things to do and it's incredibly fun.

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
 And I have only been at it for, if you're honest, about two years.

201
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,520
 So there's a very, very steep learning curve in just doing your own stuff and

202
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,120
 understanding a little more about what surrounds you.

203
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,240
 And that's why I think this is important.

204
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,040
 First of all, this planet is burning and this is very urgent.

205
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,760
 We need to find solutions.

206
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,600
 And we need to find big solutions but also small ones.

207
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,280
 And we need to do this urgently and

208
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,560
 without the sort of belief that capitalism can save any of this.

209
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,040
 We need to go in there and do little quick projects to iterate and

210
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,560
 to share our knowledge and to become more resilient.

211
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,000
 We need to learn to grow our own stuff.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,160
 And we need to learn how to forage and preserve food and make it delicious.

213
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,480
 And go out into nature and understand what surrounds us.

214
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,320
 I think the idea that we are somehow as humans separate from nature is a deeply,

215
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,400
 deeply patriarchal, colonialist, extractivist idea and this has to change.

216
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,480
 We are not in any way separate from nature.

217
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
 We are very much part of nature and we need to understand what surrounds us.

218
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,880
 If we still believe we can somehow force nature under our will,

219
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
 we will go under.

220
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,640
 So please decolonize yourself.

221
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,560
 Please understand that the idea of somehow conquering the world is a really,

222
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,840
 really, really dreadful one.

223
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:26,320
 >> [APPLAUSE]

224
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,840
 >> Thank you.

225
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,880
 And now you, hackers, people who are interested, we need you.

226
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,640
 Many projects that we do require knowledge of computers and electronics.

227
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,600
 Require an understanding of physics and mechanics.

228
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,960
 And there's so much to discover and learn and share.

229
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,040
 And there's so much fun in this because at the end, often it's very delicious as well.

230
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,520
 And, or useful, or anything.

231
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,320
 And it, you know, what we do usually is very, very sustainable.

232
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,280
 Doesn't require shipping parts from the other part of the planet and

233
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,000
 then throwing them out because you, you know, did the wrong solder.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,040
 You can't, as I said, you can't change the fundamental laws of nature.

235
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
 But if you really start listening, nature can start changing you and

236
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,360
 that is what we need as a society.

237
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,560
 So please join a space, start your own, talk to us,

238
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,840
 start doing some in your own hack spaces.

239
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,480
 We offer some support.

240
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,640
 We offer network.

241
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,400
 We are open for networking to others.

242
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,480
 You know, you can just reach me.

243
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,960
 You can reach me after the talk.

244
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,800
 You can go to our website, curious.bio.

245
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,080
 You can write to me.

246
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
 You can talk to me.

247
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:52,160
 And I rushed through all of this to have two and a half minutes of questions.

248
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,680
 Thank you.

249
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:01,480
 >> [APPLAUSE]

250
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,920
 >> Thank you so much, Julian, for

251
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,360
 sharing your experiences and showing off this great mold you grew.

252
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,200
 So if you have any questions, there is a wonderful angel with a microphone that

253
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 is smaller that you can go to and queue and ask maybe one or two questions.

254
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,360
 So please shoot.

255
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,280
 >> Hey, curious if you're doing anything with genetic engineering or

256
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,400
 trying to figure out how to get approval to be allowed to do that within

257
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,080
 the European Union.

258
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,040
 >> No, we don't do it.

259
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,520
 I know there's projects who do this kind of stuff.

260
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,520
 It is obviously dangerous.

261
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,240
 It also requires a shit ton of equipment that we do not have.

262
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,400
 I have no idea about the approval.

263
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
 That's why we grow mushrooms.

264
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
 I mean, there's also a huge, most of the stuff we do is patented, so

265
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,640
 you can't actually commercialize it.

266
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,320
 But you very much can do your open source version of it.

267
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,360
 And that's sort of for now.

268
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,840
 I know there's some projects, but we don't.

269
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:12,960
 >> Hello, how resistant is this material against humidity and this kind of-

270
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,680
 >> Humidity, not so good.

271
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,160
 Fire, quite good.

272
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 I don't know the exact specifications, but there's been a paper on fire

273
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,120
 resistance and it doesn't burn, it just smolders, so it's decent.

274
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,480
 Yeah, you don't want to put this stuff in your basement or outside.

275
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,720
 That's just not, it's going to draw water.

276
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
 And it needs to dry.

277
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,720
 You need a drying chamber because it dies, the mycelium dies at 70 degrees.

278
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,960
 So you need to get it to 70 degrees, often dry it for a while to get it really dry.

279
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,320
 But once it's dry and it's in your home, it's great.

280
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,000
 And if it's a little moist in your home, it'll just absorb moisture and

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,920
 then just let it go once it stops being moist.

282
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,720
 >> You almost answered my question already, but 70 degrees, that's centigrade?

283
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,160
 >> Yes, yes, 70 degrees centigrade.

284
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,960
 >> What do you think is the density?

285
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,000
 Is it more like styrofoam, like very light, or is it more like cardboard?

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,120
 >> It's more like polystyrene.

287
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
 It depends on the, on very many factors.

288
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
 You can tweak this.

289
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,080
 You can play around with the substrate composition.

290
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 You can, the longer you let it grow, the denser it becomes, so

291
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,760
 you have to stop it at a certain point, etc., etc.

292
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,960
 So it really depends on what you, on what you, yeah.

293
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
 >> And tweak it up and down.

294
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,400
 >> You can tweak it up and down, yeah, you can totally do that.

295
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,640
 >> I was wondering if there's a way to get more specific details on how to make

296
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,400
 the audio tunnel?

297
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
 >> On, yeah, it's, yeah.

298
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,800
 >> There is, okay.

299
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,640
 >> It's a 3D model I built basically by asking around on the Internet and

300
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,480
 figuring out and asking, actually going on YouTube, seeing something similar,

301
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,000
 talking to the guy who made the tutorial and asking me how he did it, and

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,600
 he did the tutorial for me.

303
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,440
 >> Okay, so it's all accessible online essentially.

304
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
 >> Yeah, sort of.

305
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,240
 I'll talk to you later.

306
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,740
 >> Thank you.

307
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,000
 >> We're done?

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
 Thank you very much.

309
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,880
 >> Oh, a question.

310
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,440
 >> Yeah, but we are, we are over time.

311
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,080
 Okay, here's the question.

312
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,400
 >> Yeah, I just have a question to connect with people.

313
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,200
 I'm looking for experienced people who have experience in DIY

314
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,520
 hormone production for HRT.

315
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,960
 So if you want to find me later, I'm at Art and Play over there, and

316
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
 I will stay here a while and also post it on a bulletin.

317
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,720
 >> That is super important.

318
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,560
 I know there's a couple of projects around there.

319
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,800
 There's none where we do, but I know this is a very, very important thing.

320
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,600
 >> Just because it's biohacking here.

321
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,120
 Yeah, thank you.

322
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,160
 >> Hormone replacement therapy.

323
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,040
 >> Replacement therapy, often for trans people, but also for women and menopause.

324
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,540
 Yeah.

325
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,360
 >> Okay.

326
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,080
 >> I'll answer your question after the talk.

327
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,240
 Thank you very much, everybody.

328
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,600
