 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 So welcome everybody.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.920
 This is my first time at CCC Camp.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.840
 Is it someone else's first time as well?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 Yeah.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840
 Good for us newcomers.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.120
 I thought this topic is kind of good for this camp,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.920
 but I also have a video next which has music at least

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.040
 that is good for this camp,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.560
 but it's kind of relevant to the topic.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.320
 So I thought I would play it.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.120
 Let's see if we can get it to play.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 Hopefully the Wi-Fi works and we can get it to play.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 It's essentially a very old ad that very old people like me

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 and others who are old like me will recognize.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 So let's see.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 Do we get sound?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 We got sound when we tested.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.680
 But it's the you wouldn't steal a car.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 The privacy campaign.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.040
 You wouldn't steal a bike.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.480
 You wouldn't steal the purse.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.080
 You wouldn't do that and that.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.440
 It had really good music.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.960
 So too bad.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800
 It's if someone can do some beatboxing right now,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.760
 that would be helpful.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:56.560
 Was that a pig beatboxing?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 Nice try anyway.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.960
 So since we're talking about ethics, this whole campaign

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 was essentially about not stealing a car

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.120
 and like privacy is a crime.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.760
 But then someone on the internet was like,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.880
 well, I would maybe download a car if the owner could keep the car.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
 So that would be kind of ethical and that would be kind of okay, I guess.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.800
 How many here would download a car?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.160
 Quite a few.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.660
 Thank you.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.760
 Okay, so to get started on this topic of ethics,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.840
 hackers kind of work in sometimes in peculiar domains.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.680
 So sometimes we're going on the boundaries of law and so forth.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.320
 So I thought I would take you through my short version

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320
 of the evolution of the hacker ethics as you would know it.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.160
 And this goes back even before my time.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.920
 It was like in the 60s, 70s when computers started being more common.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800
 Hackers would essentially be doing all kinds of things

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.400
 on these computers that were not really accessible to everyone yet.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.680
 And they kind of went through this stage where they had this,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.640
 the hacker ethic.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.080
 There was a guy who wrote a book

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.080
 and Richard Solomon, which is considered the last true hacker,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.320
 said about ethics in that book like this,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.720
 that the hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
 to the ethical ideas this community of people had.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.560
 That knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.280
 and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.440
 And I think probably quite a few of us can stand behind that statement.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:02.480
 Also, the hacker ethic can kind of be summarized into, in that era,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.080
 exceptional single mindedness and determination to keep plugging away

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.440
 at a problem until the optimal solution had been found.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.640
 Our well-documented traits of the early hackers,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.040
 willingness to work right through the night on a single programming problem

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.120
 are widely cited as features of the early hacker computer culture.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.600
 Who here has spent an entire night figuring out a problem?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.160
 Okay, quite a few.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.080
 So you can also consider yourself early hackers in a way.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.400
 And then when we go a bit further, maybe to the 80s,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.080
 things started shifting, there started to be sort of more...

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.040
 The ethics started dwindling maybe a little bit more.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.480
 There was some white hat, black hat stuff going on in the 90s as well.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.200
 There started to be a little bit more of a divide

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.760
 and people started going to jail for doing criminal stuff, so black hats.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.880
 And there started to be more like a divide of white hats and black hats.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.960
 And the hacker manifesto was written by a guy called the mentor.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.280
 And essentially his statement in that manifesto is that

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.080
 this is our world now, the world of the electron and the switch.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.320
 The beauty of the board, we make use of a service already existing

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.360
 without paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.600
 And you call us criminals.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.560
 We explore and you call us criminals.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.440
 We seek after knowledge and you call us criminals.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.800
 So it's more like a hacktivism kind of freedom to all information and all data kind of era.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.160
 And then to kind of sum up the...

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.080
 Or to get back more to today.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.040
 Today we have sort of...

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.120
 We don't really have these clear-cut maybe books.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.560
 Well, we do have some books, but...

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.360
 At least for me, working in this industry,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.560
 I don't really come across that many ethical sort of statements and things like that.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.640
 Some of them we might see in ethical hacking certificates,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.640
 but they're very sort of rudimentary.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.880
 Don't test without permission.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.640
 Don't be an asshole.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.960
 Don't break shit and steal stuff and so forth.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.160
 And those are kind of okay, but...

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.400
 I feel like there should be maybe a little bit more.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.240
 And some of the bug bounty platforms,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.200
 because I work with bug bounty as well,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.600
 some of the bug bounty platforms have these kind of code of conduct.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600
 So they have like, you know, you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.960
 you know, respect others, you know, and things like that.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.800
 And don't go out of scope.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.840
 And scope is kind of the limitation where companies in bug bounty programs,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.240
 they say, "You can test this, but don't test this."

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.840
 And then someone goes and tests this, and then what should happen?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.000
 Sometimes not much.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.600
 So this was kind of the super quick background of hacker ethics.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.280
 And what really got me into this talk was the...

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.520
 kind of the things that I've seen recently that made me think,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.160
 "Okay, maybe we should have even more discussions about ethics

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.400
 when it comes to security testing, and especially in the bug bounty

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.640
 space where I work a lot."

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.880
 And if you're not aware of bug bounty, it's essentially security testing for a reward.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.640
 So you do some testing, and you send in a report through usually a bug bounty platform,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 and the company will pay a reward based on how severe the issue is.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.840
 And some of the things that I've seen will kind of touch upon both security testing

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.160
 and the bug bounty area, because that's what I know.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.480
 So probably there's much more sort of things that go on,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.280
 but these are the things that I thought I would share with you,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.920
 because it might not be that well known, some of them at least.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.560
 But we'll start with the really simple ones.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.240
 You're testing with permission, and then you bring down some servers.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.080
 It's probably happened to a few, maybe here.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.800
 Has it happened to any of you?

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.080
 Yeah? Okay, a couple.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.400
 I see my colleagues over there as well.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:57.040
 We've done this, unfortunately, quite a few times, and it really boils down to,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.600
 maybe we should have done more due diligence.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.520
 Maybe the computers that we were testing were in a broom closet somewhere,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.800
 or it was like a Raspberry Pi that really couldn't handle many requests,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.520
 so it just cannot handle anything automated, and it just dies.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.920
 So we're not really doing a service for the customer

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.640
 or the individual that we're testing, and probably not anyone else.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.800
 And it's not really nice getting a call from the client saying,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.720
 "Oh, you brought our servers down. What are you doing? Stop doing whatever you're doing.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.160
 It's not cool. Our production is down."

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.600
 And then you find out their production is running on potatoes,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.920
 so that's also a good finding in itself.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:50.480
 All right, so now for the more gray area of the things that I have seen recently.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.520
 Someone popped the champagne, and that's great.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.800
 And I have introduced this arbitrary Gandalf the gray scale.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.760
 Some of you might not see it, but depending on how gray I believe it would be,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.640
 there's a number of Gandalfs in there to represent how gray this thing might be.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.800
 So let's get started with the first one.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.840
 So the first one kind of goes from the first example we had,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.520
 testing without permission and then bringing down servers, for example.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.600
 I would give it maybe like one Gandalf.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.760
 I mean, it's kind of like, yeah, and in some cases,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.160
 it's maybe not that legal as well in some countries.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.640
 You know, you're not really allowed to test without permission.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.080
 So I'll give it one Gandalf maybe.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:45.360
 Then the other one is stumbling across a vulnerability without permission,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.880
 but then you kind of notify the target company through, for example, your local cert.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.440
 And the local cert in many of our European countries especially

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.120
 protect the hacker from the company if they want to pursue you as a hacker.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.200
 So they protect you as an individual as well so you don't get pursued

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.520
 because it's a cert contacting the company.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.040
 I'll give this maybe like one Gandalf, maybe not even a single Gandalf,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.120
 maybe a hobbit, I don't know.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:22.720
 And then we have this really awesome thing,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.720
 testing without permission and then blackmailing the target.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.760
 Reward me or else something will happen.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.040
 Someone will hack you.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.960
 It's not me, but here's my full name.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:44.000
 A lot of times, we've seen these types of individuals contact companies directly

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.360
 and saying like they have a terrible vulnerability and it's really critical

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.680
 and you need to pay me right away.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.240
 And then when you start asking, okay, what is this vulnerability actually?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.720
 Then it's like, okay, well, you have a file that shouldn't be there.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.960
 It could be really almost nothing and they want a reward for it.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.760
 Sometimes it could actually be something, but you don't really know

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.600
 until you get into this super annoying conversation.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.360
 Usually, it's almost like spam or like a scam where they really like try to get you.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.240
 They might send the CEO of the company this email and they scramble all the jets like,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.600
 whoa, something is going on and it's not really good for business either.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.680
 So it's quite interrupting as well.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.600
 So you're not really benefiting anyone, I would say.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.920
 I'll give it one, maybe two Gandalfs.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:44.000
 And then there's a new really cool trend, marketing trend,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.480
 where you test without permission with your super awesome service

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.800
 that finds vulnerabilities.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.840
 And then you send an email to the company saying,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.400
 my super cool service found hundreds of vulnerabilities in your company.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.800
 Let's meet up and have an online meeting and talk.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.520
 So they're trying to sell it to you and it's usually,

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.320
 like there's a different scale of how aggressive they are.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.240
 Some of them are very aggressive.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.520
 Some of them might, for example, contact everyone in the organization

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.840
 to try and sell this service that they have.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.440
 We've seen it.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.360
 It's really cool and it really doesn't get you any sales,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.720
 at least if you contact us.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.000
 But for some it might work.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.600
 I would give this maybe one Gandalf, two Gandalfs,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.000
 depending on how aggressive it is.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.080
 And then another really nice trend that we have seen recently

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.840
 is that you purchase stolen credentials off the dark web

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.040
 and then you ask the company to give you an award.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.120
 So they submit it to a bug bounty program.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.080
 So maybe they found the credentials of one of your employees,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.280
 maybe it's an IT admin,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.440
 and then they submit it to a bug bounty program in hopes for a reward.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.200
 And in their submission, they say, I purchased these off the dark web.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.120
 Okay, well, if you're a company, it's like,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.360
 if you say that, we can't really reward you

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.960
 because that's not legal to buy stolen stuff.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.480
 Normally, companies can't do it.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.760
 Some do it anyway, and some have been known to pay for them as well.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.440
 I know some, I'm not going to name names,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.080
 but it has been happening.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.240
 And the rewards have sometimes been pretty substantial.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.240
 I'll give it maybe three Gandalfs, maybe four.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.720
 One of the issues that I see with this is,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.880
 obviously, there's a meme if you can't see it,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.040
 it says the secret ingredient is crime.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.520
 So if you're not very good at hacking,

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.200
 maybe you can go to the dark web and do this.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.160
 But one of the issues that I see with this is that

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.680
 there's a sort of basic thing with how markets work in general.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.520
 So if you, let's say, everyone starts doing it

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.360
 because it's very profitable,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.480
 then we have a huge demand for stolen credentials coming in.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.200
 All the ethical hackers of the world want to buy stolen credentials.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.720
 And then the criminals are going like,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.280
 oh, shit, we have a huge demand.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.080
 What should we do?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.120
 All right, let's increase the criminal activity

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.720
 so we can get some more supply.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.080
 And then the supply and demand cycle just,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.800
 it just starts going.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.720
 And, yeah, I don't know.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.920
 It's kind of a bit of a problem, I would say, to do this.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.920
 Maybe later, some of you can discuss how ethical it really is,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.480
 and is it really an ethical hacker kind of thing to do?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.080
 Then, to take this a bit further,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.600
 is maybe, I don't know if you know,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.920
 but there are services that you can subscribe to

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.080
 where you can purchase stolen credentials of the dark web.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:24.960
 Oh, sorry, the service purchases the credentials for you from the dark web.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.920
 So it's kind of like a Netflix of crime, you know?

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.360
 So it's like, okay, I'll just subscribe to this service

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.120
 and I'll get all the stolen credentials.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.360
 So I don't know, maybe,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.600
 what if you had a Netflix for stolen cars?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.720
 Would you subscribe to that?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.680
 I don't know.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.440
 But this is kind of,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.000
 I mean, it gets a little bit more difficult

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.280
 because now you're just,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.920
 you're not buying the credentials yourself,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.320
 but you have a proxy that's buying them

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.160
 and you're subscribing to the service.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.560
 And there's multiple services like this.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.280
 Probably, some of you know,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.960
 if you want to use them, don't ask me.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.760
 But yeah, I would give this maybe three gandalfs

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.040
 on the gray scale.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.640
 And of course, when they do both these things,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.920
 they submit them to companies running bug bounty programs

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.200
 in hopes of rewards.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.080
 So yeah, that's great.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.200
 And I kind of like to always take a step forward

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.160
 and go in further.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.520
 So what if you exploit the Netflix of crime

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.800
 to get those credentials

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.320
 and then submit that to a bug bounty program

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.440
 in hopes for reward?

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.160
 I give it maybe five gandalfs

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.960
 because it kind of goes like even further.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.480
 So you're doing a crime on a service

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.800
 that is doing, well, buying stolen stuff

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.680
 and selling that as a subscription.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 I would give it maybe five gandalfs.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.640
 What do you think?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.280
 Yeah, maybe.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.640
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.440
 Yeah, maybe keep your enemies close, I guess.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.920
 Then I saw a new trend popping up lately.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.520
 We've all known of credential stuffing in general

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.280
 as an attack used by criminals.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.640
 But ethical hackers in the bug bounty scene

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.240
 have started using it as well.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.320
 So they take leaked credentials off the web

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.800
 and then they try it on everything.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.000
 And if it works, then they submit a report

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.720
 to the company in hopes for a reward.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:04.240
 And I don't know, maybe not that great,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.600
 but should you really, usually in the policies

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.800
 of these bug bounty programs, they kind of say

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.440
 like you're not maybe allowed to do this kind of things.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.360
 Maybe you're not allowed to get credentials

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.240
 for certain things.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.240
 But then if you take it from some leaked dumps online

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.240
 and you use that and check if they work,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.000
 maybe, I don't know, could be.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.760
 Maybe a little grayish, maybe.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.560
 I'll give it maybe four, three Gandalfs maybe.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.800
 But then there's purchasing stolen credentials

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.840
 of the dark web and using those for credential stuffing.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.960
 So it goes again a step further.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.080
 I wonder what the next step after this would be,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.960
 but I guess we'll find out pretty soon.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.360
 But I would give this maybe five Gandalfs

00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.480
 because let's say ethical hacker purchases credentials

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.880
 of your company online.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.880
 Then they take those credentials.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.720
 They don't give it to you yet.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.040
 They're just going to test if it works everywhere.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.680
 And then if it works, which it might,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.520
 then after that and after gaining access

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.160
 to a certain system, maybe it's really bad, right?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.280
 They go into that system and then they also check

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.800
 what they can access in that system, of course.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:35.520
 So it kind of goes maybe a smidge too far in some cases,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.320
 I would say.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.280
 I would give it five Gandalfs maybe.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:49.520
 So just to kind of, because there was some secret ingredients

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.800
 in this presentation and a lot of them

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.120
 had to do with crime, I was thinking that I would kind of

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.400
 just quickly go through the legals of Finland

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.440
 because I'm from Finland.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.720
 So if you purchase stolen goods, regardless of how much it costs,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.240
 you can get up to one year and six months of jail time.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.600
 And in Germany, you get five years or a fine.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.600
 Germans, it's like what?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.120
 Or a fine, like what does it depend on?

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.160
 I don't know, but maybe you guys probably know

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.120
 what it depends on, but...

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.320
 The judge, okay.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.840
 So if you're good buddies with the judge,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.120
 you only get a fine.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.720
 Yeah, probably it's also depending on how severe it is

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.080
 and so forth.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.600
 In Canada and US, if the values exceed over $5,000,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 so let's say I run a bug bounty program,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.280
 someone gives, they've bought stolen credentials.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.400
 They want me to give them a reward.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.760
 I'm a US company.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.240
 I give them a reward over $5,000.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.680
 I've committed a federal crime.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:06.240
 This may or may not have happened.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.920
 I may or may not know and I may or may not say anything.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.560
 In Canada, you can get up to 10 years in prison.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.160
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.080
 The company is committing a crime by paying a reward

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.120
 to somebody who has stolen the credentials.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:43.520
 Even if they're your own clients?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.720
 Yeah, there is some differences if it's your own,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.000
 but it depends on the legal.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.960
 I'm not a lawyer, so maybe consult a lawyer.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.000
 Don't listen to me regarding legal stuff.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.240
 Or well, the basics, you should know that it could be a crime.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:11.440
 And I think at this camp, I already saw an Italian lawyer

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.200
 on stage at one of the lightning talks.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.120
 So he probably knows a bit more than me about the legal stuff.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.840
 But since some of this is like a little bit gray area,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.520
 or maybe not, and some of it might be criminal,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.800
 or maybe not, I'm not sure.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:36.000
 But what I'm thinking is that also because maybe some of these stolen goods

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.280
 or like stolen credentials, they're too accessible.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.600
 Maybe that's also a part of the issue.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.480
 Like you can just subscribe to this Netflix of crime

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.560
 and like get your crime feed into your inbox.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.720
 So maybe that's part of the problem.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.280
 I'm not sure.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.840
 It's not that difficult to go on the dark web and buy credentials,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.680
 stolen credentials, or stolen anything, really.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.280
 Maybe it's just too accessible.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.840
 So maybe in some cases, for example, the ethical hackers that are doing it,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.000
 maybe they're not just thinking too much about the ethics of it all.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.680
 They're just doing it because there's a reward at the end.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:23.120
 Another kind of issue that we've seen in the bug bounty scene especially

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.920
 is that you hold on to vulnerabilities in the pursuit of rewards.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.440
 So essentially, you have maybe a cool vulnerability

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.440
 that you've discovered yourself.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.560
 You're not going to share it because then others might use it

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.600
 to get the rewards.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.400
 So you want to make sure that you've collected all the rewards

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.000
 from all the different companies.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.920
 And I'm not sure how ethical that is.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.880
 I forgot to put the Gandalfs here, but maybe a couple of Gandalfs on that one.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.240
 Essentially, the hacker ethics from the early days at least

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.920
 was to be open and share.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.560
 And I personally, I believe in that being a good thing.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.920
 But I can also understand why they would want to hold on

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.160
 to certain types of vulnerabilities if it's in their own benefit.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.760
 Obviously, everyone has hungry mouths to feed, including their own.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:26.880
 Another issue that I've seen also is it kind of goes into the ethics

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.880
 of bug bounty as well, is that in a lot of cases,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.280
 the bug bounty programs, they define a policy.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.000
 You define a policy, you're allowed to do this and that,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.200
 and go so and so far.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.200
 But the company themselves, for example, they pay the researcher

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.280
 or the hacker, the ethical hacker, based on the impact of the finding.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.120
 So in some cases, even if you have these sort of arbitrary limitations

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.840
 from policy, the hackers might have an incentive to actually go further

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:07.520
 to increase the impact of the vulnerability so they can get a higher reward.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.560
 So there's kind of like a dilemma in this issue because it's like,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:19.120
 in theory, you shouldn't, but if you do, you might get a higher reward.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.960
 So maybe you should, but should you really?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.920
 And it really kind of plays back into the ethical boundaries

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.560
 of that particular hacker, how far will they go?

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:40.800
 And we've seen cases of ethical hackers dumping databases and going even further.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.280
 So I don't know how many Gandalfs this one should be,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.320
 but maybe both the hacker and the company should get a few Gandalfs for this one.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:03.040
 And then, of course, there's secret techniques or open sharing.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:08.960
 Some prefer to have their secret techniques and keep them to themselves

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.760
 because there's more rewards for them.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.240
 Some prefer to share everything.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:20.960
 And I guess one of the reasons I wanted to talk at this camp

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.160
 about these issues as well is that there's probably a lot of you that

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.840
 also are interested in discussing these things and seeing where this should go.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:37.680
 And I don't know, in my opinion, it would be better if everyone would share,

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.320
 but some people prefer to keep some techniques to themselves.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:49.520
 So what is then actually ethical hacking?

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.680
 I mean, there are some boundaries.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.600
 Some of them are legal, but some of them, even the legal boundaries,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.960
 are not that well known.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.640
 There might be also different types of boundaries,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.600
 depending on the country that the company is in and also where the hacker is in.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.800
 So it might be difficult to sort of set the boundaries even legally

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.440
 because it depends sometimes.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.000
 So what should the boundaries be?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.360
 And who should define them?

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.400
 What is ethical hacking?

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.440
 And how can we as a community improve on these issues?

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:37.600
 And I guess the final question, what does your moral compass look like?

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.000
 In which direction does it point?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.680
 Are you a white hat, a black hat, or something in between, or a mix of them all?

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.960
 And I guess this presentation was a lot faster than I was planning on.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:01.200
 So in case you need to find me later, you can find me at the Salmiaki Village in Cold North.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.760
 There's my contact details, and apparently I was too fast.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.160
 Apparently I was too fast.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.600
 Thanks Joachim.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:28.080
 It looks like we have about 15 minutes for questions.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.480
 If there are any, are there any questions from the internet?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.520
 None? Any questions from the audience?

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.080
 Please line up over there by the microphone.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.220
 Thank you.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:45.780
 Hi, I'm not an expert whatsoever.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.300
 I'm a total movie, so this question might be a little bit stupid.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:55.700
 But from what I understood, you considered the interest of the people being hacked,

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.620
 and the interest of the people who were hacking.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.620
 What about the greater good?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.940
 What about people who are not related to the company, not related to the hacker?

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:10.500
 Like everybody, isn't that a very relevant question for whether it's ethical or not?

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.340
 Does it benefit everybody, what I'm doing as a hacker?

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.060
 Or does it worsen the situation for everyone?

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:24.020
 Yeah, I mean, and it also depends.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:29.060
 Does it benefit everybody, or a large amount of people, or a few people?

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.300
 It's a difficult question really to answer.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.660
 I don't really have an answer, I guess.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:40.180
 Yeah, it's ethics.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:48.020
 Hey, you focused on the legality a lot, and on, you know,

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.660
 let's call it technical hardcore hacks.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.900
 But some of the stuff that you had, where is it with credentials?

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.100
 And just yesterday we had a cool presentation by Kirilis,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.700
 I don't know if he's there, on social engineering.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.340
 And I mean, you know, the most obvious kind of social engineering is super duper direct,

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.420
 and then it's fairly in your face, and okay, you've got the credential, that's it.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.500
 But once you go for the higher value targets, usually you start to build up networks,

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.740
 and it's human level trust that you have to build with a lot of people

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.940
 to build your network to actually get at the whale that you're aiming at.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.780
 And then you betray those people.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.740
 And that can have real psychological impact on those people.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.020
 We had a really cool discussion after the session yesterday with a bunch of friends.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.740
 This is not something I see discussed a lot in ethical hacking, you know,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.100
 the psychological impact on, oh, fuck, I trusted that guy.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.460
 So what are your thoughts on that?

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:44.500
 Yeah, that's right.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.500
 Betraying trust can be very detrimental, like, regarding the person's mental health.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:56.420
 And we also see, for example, a lot of people that are victims to cybercrime also,

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.100
 they suffer greatly sometimes.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.740
 So in some cases, I think we should maybe have some like victim health care,

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.660
 like the cybercrime health care station or something.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.900
 I don't know what that would look like.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.060
 But it's very difficult for people mentally, especially if they're,

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.340
 for example, the entry point to a bigger event, then it's very hard on them.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.740
 Once it dawns on them that this really was serious.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.900
 So yeah, there's a lot to improve on that area as well.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:36.580
 Any more questions?

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.220
 Maybe just a comment.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.580
 What you just talked about is what's called a second victim in safety literature.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.900
 Like the pilot who is like, you know, like the plane crashed, right?

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.980
 Let's say some people died.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.380
 Like, it's not good, but it's not really the pilot's fault.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.940
 Almost never, like very rarely.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.620
 But they feel really responsible and sometimes commit acts against themselves.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.500
 Let's just put it that way.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.380
 So actually, in general, security, I think, would benefit a lot from safety literature.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.740
 But that's a different discussion to be here.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.580
 All right.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:18.500
 So that's one more question, it seems.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:26.500
 What's the revenue?

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:32.500
 Revenue who does the service is 6.8 million last year.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.660
 I work for a big enterprise.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.780
 This is private.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.500
 So how do you feel about that revenue number?

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.260
 6.8 million.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.100
 Revenue.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.420
 What?

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:42.900
 Sorry.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.100
 Spy cloud.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:52.180
 The service enterprises subscribe to get essentially leaks, dumps, credits of their own input?

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:57.380
 Yeah, that's one of the services that you can subscribe to.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.980
 I mean, I'm not sure how ethical.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:08.020
 There's also other sort of cyber threat intelligence related companies that provide stolen credentials, etc.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.620
 It's gray area.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.020
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.540
 That's, I guess, one of the questions I also have.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.260
 Like, I'm not sure what's right and what's wrong.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:36.740
 So probably more discussions are needed to find the boundaries and what's right and what's wrong.
