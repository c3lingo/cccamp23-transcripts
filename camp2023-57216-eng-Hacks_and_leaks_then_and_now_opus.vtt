00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:39.240
 Nice to see you all again in this sun coming from the rear,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.800
 grilling everybody.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.200
 Please still remember, drink more water and keep the walkways free.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.240
 As we talked so much already due to the power failure,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.640
 sadly, neither on the stream nor on the recording.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 I without further ado give it to Gabriella Coleman and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
 to Jeremy Hammond to talk about activism.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.880
 >> Great, thanks so much.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.400
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.800
 >> All right, so I'll be contextualizing

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.360
 the hack and leak, no surprise.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.640
 So I have a very specific definition for the hack and leak.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.360
 So it's a tactic executed by hacker outsiders who hack deliberately into

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.240
 some org server place to snatch documents and material.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560
 They publicize the intrusion, that's really important, and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.760
 stolen material to drum up interest in the leaks.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.560
 It was initially used mainly for whistle blowing, but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 is now also used by different actors, like nation states, for different purposes.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 I'll be concentrating more on this sort of hacktivist tactic.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.480
 Today, it's really a firm part of the hacktivist landscape.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.600
 Guacamaya, if you have not heard of them, are rocking the hack and

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.760
 leak in Latin America.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.240
 They hacked the Mexican military, for example.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.000
 And really since 2011 and 12, you really just have a tremendous amount of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.120
 sort of hacktivist activity with this very deliberate tactic.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.000
 As I sort of mentioned after our technical snafu, this was so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 not obvious to put together the chocolate hack and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 the peanut butter leak and put them together.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.160
 And in fact, one of the fascinating things was that I interviewed for

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.480
 a very different project.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 A lot of hackers who were like pwning and owning systems in the 90s and 2000s.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.720
 And many were not ideologically inclined to do hacktivism, but

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 some certainly were, and there were a lot of hacktivists doing also website

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.000
 defacements.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 And one hacker actually from Europe during an interview said,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.960
 I wish we had done something about it, but we didn't.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.800
 I think we could have exposed a lot of corruption, a lot of wrongdoing of a lot

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.240
 of high profile political people because they had access to their servers.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.040
 Now just to kind of give you a sense of how much more hacking and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.360
 leaking we have, here's a list from 2010 to the present and it's partial.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.320
 I could add another dozen examples.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.480
 And before 2010, you've really got four in that sort of English speaking world,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.000
 at least, and only two of them really kind of fit with my definition.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 So as I mentioned, it was not obvious.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.920
 2009 is really the first instance where you have this tactic fully formed.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 But what's interesting about the two, which I'll get to later,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.840
 was that people didn't copycat them.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.680
 And it wasn't until anonymous hacktivists actually independently and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.040
 accidentally stumbled upon this tactic that then it really started to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 cement into a template for emulation.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.240
 So here's a very truncated genealogy.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.520
 So even though I sort of identify 2009 as the kind of time where this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.120
 came into being, I often like to give analog examples.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.720
 And there is a really amazing example of a group of activists,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720
 the Citizens Commission to expose the FBI, who has heard of them.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.920
 So a few, they actually broke into an FBI field office in media Pennsylvania,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.720
 took like three, four suitcases of files, photocopied the documents,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.760
 sent them to journalists, and eventually, co-intel pro,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.360
 one of the most horrific sort of programs against activists was exposed.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.240
 And this is a kind of hack and leak.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 Obviously, it's very hard to break into a building and take documents, so

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.040
 that wasn't really replicated very often.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.200
 Now, it wasn't until 2003 where you have something similar,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.880
 where you have some big email dumps that were not from hacks.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.480
 And one has to do with a deep old voting machine.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.520
 Someone found documents and source code and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.120
 email on unencrypted FTP server, took them.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.120
 And then some obscure government official kind of dumped the Enron emails,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.880
 they were involved in fraud.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.880
 And these were super interesting because basically journalists could not be

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.280
 bothered to mind them, right?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.080
 And it took amazing amount of effort to even sort of cover the documents that

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.400
 were found.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.640
 In the case of D-Bold, for example, there were some stories about

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.800
 the vulnerabilities, but in this piece, actually,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.280
 Paul Krugman is reflecting why the fuck didn't anyone go into the documents and

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400
 emails and report on them.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.680
 Now, going through email is a bitch.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.120
 No one likes to do it.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.000
 It's difficult.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.720
 You didn't really have boutique tech reporting as much as you did today.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.080
 So there's reasons for that, but

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.040
 I think it also shows that it really wasn't on people's mental map.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.280
 So in 2009, you have two bona fide hacks and leaks.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.800
 You have one against a university in England, and it was Climate Gate.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.600
 And we don't know who took those emails.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.360
 They dumped them to kind of seed mistrust around climate science.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.320
 And this got a lot of news.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.760
 It was all over the news.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.680
 I'm not gonna talk about it.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.520
 It didn't seem to inspire copycats.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.800
 The second one was given to WikiLeaks and was signed anti-fascist hackers.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.120
 And it was against Holocaust denier David Irving.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.480
 And it did make a little bit of the press.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.960
 And eventually, we learned that it was Jeremy Hammond.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.560
 He did it.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.040
 And this is, again, one of the first bona fide hacks and leaks.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.760
 >> Fucking hack-nappy website.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.280
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.560
 Now what's so interesting is that eventually, I could sort of interview him about this stuff.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.120
 And I sort of asked about, where did you get this idea?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.240
 What was your sort of inspiration, right?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.600
 It wasn't that one day he's like, here's the peanut butter, here's the chocolate,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.560
 I'll put it together.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.640
 He was part of the hacker underground.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.160
 And there was a cultural movement called Antisec.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.920
 Who here heard of Antisec?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.680
 Not the recent one, but the one from early 2000s.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.320
 Yeah, Antisec won.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320
 Very few people.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.080
 So in the early 2000s, a bunch of hackers who were part of the underground were

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.240
 professionalizing, they were getting jobs.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.200
 And there was a small crew of people who were like, screw that,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.800
 we wanna preserve our cultural kingdom.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.640
 We want our exploits and vulnerabilities.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.520
 So they went on a rampage against white hat hackers.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.360
 And what they did was they hacked them, took their emails, dumped them, but

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.840
 not for whistle blowing, it was just for shaming them, right?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.480
 And Jeremy was like, that's badass, but maybe we can reformulate that and

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.160
 reformat that for political purposes.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.160
 And initially, he would take emails and then share them with a small network of

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.720
 people, not publicly.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.720
 And it wasn't till the WikiLeaks era where again,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.200
 the chocolate and peanut butter came together.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.480
 So he did this in 2009, he's on probation, very independently.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.400
 Anonymous comes into being, and very accidentally,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.600
 I don't have the time to go into the details.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.600
 They start to stumble on emails, into emails, sometimes not through hacks,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.160
 sometimes through hacks, and it's all over the news.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.200
 Jeremy's on the sidelines, he's super excited.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.160
 At a certain point, he's like, I can't help myself, I'm gonna kind of join.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:23.360
 And he does when LulzSec is disbanding, and very deliberately creates Antisec,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.800
 a kind of new version, where you're really deliberately hacking and

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.120
 leaking and some side of sabotage as well.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.400
 Doing things like fuck FBI Fridays,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.680
 where you try to time a hack and leak every Friday.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.760
 So that's a very brief genealogy.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.000
 There's lots of interesting things else to say.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.800
 But in 2012, a lot of people get arrested, and

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.720
 it's not really clear whether this would continue, right?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.600
 It's all over the news, but are people gonna basically copycat it, right?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.400
 And I wasn't sure myself.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.280
 I myself at this point also thought this tactic existed since the 1980s.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.200
 I took it for granted.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.840
 In 2014, the answer came with LulzSec Peru, with Phineas Fisher.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.480
 Then you also have Guardians of Peace, which is a nation state group, right?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.760
 So the tactic begins to morph, but

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.280
 it really starts to grow some serious roots into the ground.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.440
 And what is also interesting, and

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.920
 I'm wrapping up so that we could turn over to Jeremy, is that you have

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.840
 groups like Phineas Fisher, who are not quite as visible.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.800
 They're not there doing 50 days of hacking in a row.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.080
 They're striking maybe one year or a few times, then in 2016 for

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.000
 a few more times, but they're writing manifestos with extremely detailed

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.600
 instructions for how not to get caught, right?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.120
 And indeed, whether it's Phineas Fisher or Guacamea,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.240
 now we have this tactic where these groups, individuals,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.360
 who knows who are doing this, but evading capture.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.760
 So that's all I'm gonna say.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:06.120
 If you're interested in the 40 page version, feel free to email me.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.080
 But otherwise, I'm now gonna turn it over to Jeremy for his bit.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.640
 Thank you.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.840
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.120
 >> Okay.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.620
 >> Okay.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.560
 >> Beale, you're the best.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.720
 >> I've been learning this for a long time.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.080
 I was just learning it myself, learning it by doing basically.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.800
 I'm a back encoder and I'm pretty skilled at remote intrusion, but

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.760
 I'm not actually particularly the best, right?

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.160
 None of us are, but what I found is that how many 15 million security

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.520
 contractors are there that could be a potential Snowden but ain't?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.040
 Because in the United States, a lot of tech workers and

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.160
 developers are basically complicit with the system.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.040
 How do I full screen this shit?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.000
 This is very embarrassing.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.480
 >> [LAUGH] >> I don't use PowerPoint, right?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.000
 My God.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.620
 Command F.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.160
 So anyways, white hats.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:06.580
 My God.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:14.260
 Thunderbird?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.560
 All right, so what to do?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.720
 This is also single slides, but I can just do it on mine.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.220
 Sorry about this.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:34.520
 There we go.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.080
 All right, let's burn some shit.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.800
 So it's time to draw a line of the sand.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.200
 And it's time for hackers to develop some class consciousness.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.320
 Occupy Wall Street, we're the 99%.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.880
 But there's obviously intersectionalities and so forth.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.720
 And I think honestly we've been a little bit too patient with those who are

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.080
 complicit with the corporate security.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.840
 These professionals are harmless now.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.040
 Now granted, I am so inspired by what y'all have built here.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.640
 I wish we could do the same thing in the United States where it's desperately

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.880
 needed.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.040
 But what we have right now, how things have changed,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.240
 I just got a smartphone like two years for the first time when I got out of prison.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.480
 I was on all these ridiculous monitoring shits.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.720
 And I was just coming to terms with the rise of big tech and

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.880
 what Corey Doctorow calls in shitification and

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.160
 all these new complex ideologies that test creals like the Musks and

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.040
 the Peter Thiels and this crypto stuff.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.880
 This futures and where those are left behind.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.160
 And all this Panopticon surveillance stuff would only be made possible by

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.440
 those developers who had chose the paycheck over principle.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.360
 And so, and hackers, the vision of information was just free.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.240
 We'd all just result in this utopian, but

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.560
 unfortunately was not able to contend with the forces of neoliberal capitalism,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.720
 which is a masterful recuperation of hackers.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.720
 That's why you see hack labs turn to hacker spaces and now maker spaces and

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.280
 stuff like that and DefCon and so forth, right?

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.000
 So it's time to make hacking a threat again.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.600
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.800
 >> I love those little fishes, man.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.280
 But hey, so these are some tips and stuff like that that I thought what were our

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.960
 strengths that made work.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.680
 Anonymity, encryption, ops, compartmentalization, need to know.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.760
 I will say that the reasons why I've been busted at any of these times is not

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.160
 because of any of the failures of the technology itself.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.000
 First off, shout out to the Tor project.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.160
 I relied on that shit for nine months and that's not how they caught me.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.440
 I made my own mistakes by running my mouth mostly and trusting people and so

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.400
 forth, but encryption works.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.760
 Al Snowden said it himself.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.400
 But if you just need to be precise though, of course, right?

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.600
 What also works is memetic action.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.520
 Replicable action, creating openings, be like water like they said in Hong Kong,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.160
 I believe.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.840
 Basically, I've worked in a lot of protests and organizations and so forth, right?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.240
 And I'm an anarchist, but so we have a criticism of centralized and

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.600
 hierarchical organizational structures and I think the future is more memetic

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.520
 action. I think that's one of anonymous' strengths is to learn how to the virality.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.040
 And also because you don't have to wait to do it yourself.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.440
 You could just be inspired.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.880
 If you see something, it recognizes it.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.840
 Like I have some examples down here.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.560
 Stuff like graffiti, raves, flash mobs, hopping and turnstile, team takeovers and

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.840
 so forth.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.800
 Or like in Chicago, we have like these team takeovers, these slides where people

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.960
 just have these spontaneous public gatherings and so forth.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.400
 That just, it's guerrilla stuff, hit and run.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.760
 Diversity of tactics.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.040
 You know, there's no one way to do it.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.720
 There's many ways.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.200
 There's many worlds.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.600
 You know, sometimes you have to know what card to play at the right moment.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.080
 Sometimes it's just got to boil over though and you got to take action.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.360
 But I came up handing flyers and going to anti-war protests and stuff like that and

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.120
 thinking possibly naively that you could change things by that the people in power

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.680
 will be willing to listen to you or they'll be able to, you could achieve reforms

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.280
 through this system.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.720
 It took my head being whacked by batons.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.560
 It took a lot of time in jail and a lot of bogus charges in jail.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.000
 Sometimes it is, sometimes it didn't do it though.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.240
 And I had to learn that the whole thing just has to go completely.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.720
 Right?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.920
 And so direct action, hey, it gets the goods, baby.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.080
 There's a lot of activism though.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.360
 You know, you don't all have to, we don't all got to be the hero to break stuff.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.160
 You know, we choose our own level of involvement.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.000
 We're all not uniquely positioned in our lives.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.800
 Again, there's all forms of defensive hacktivism.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.000
 These hacker spaces creating these incubations and developing software and

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.200
 audits are all part of this diversity of tactics.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.480
 Decentralized deterrence, discourage recruitment of cops, law enforcement,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.960
 white hats.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.960
 If they thought, first off, a cop shouldn't be able to get a bar in any fucking place,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.120
 you know, anywhere, they shouldn't, you know, if white hats were like that too,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.520
 maybe we'd have less white hats developing the hacking team spy shit,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.840
 the surveillance, all that.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:41.040
 So Antisec, big fan, we chose targeting the white hats as the weak link because

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.680
 also, first off, their emails, they got the credentials, they got the live

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.040
 vulnerabilities, they got the keys to the kingdom.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.960
 So we're after that shit.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.560
 Get the mail, get it all.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.200
 All right.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.520
 Mistakes were made.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.560
 But they didn't stop us from learning our lessons and moving on.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.880
 You know, my first time I hacked a protest wire is like a right wing counter

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.960
 counter protester thing.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.800
 They were kind of like doxing us.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.920
 And like Biela had said, a lot of the work I was doing was a lot of anti-fascist

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.880
 work, knowing and mapping the right wing networks.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.160
 And again, like hacking that, all of it has to be spectacular front page news

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.720
 defacement.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.000
 Sometimes it's like quietly and listen, right?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.920
 And knowing where to distribute that data to those that matter.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.200
 You know, we need to know who these Nazis are in our neighborhoods.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.200
 We need to know their connections, whether they are also police officers or

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.240
 work in security themselves or generally.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.560
 And also it works.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.240
 You know what I mean?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.720
 So the David Irving one, I went after that because he was on a speaking tour.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.760
 And we did the secret location and all this type of stuff.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.320
 And so we were able to hack his emails, get all the meeting locations he had to

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.680
 cancel it.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.600
 Also the attendees, those who attended, these neo-Nazis and so forth.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 So now I chose to release it to WikiLeaks because that was a stable platform that

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.400
 was at the time that distributed no questions asked, right?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.560
 And so it's like, you know, it's one of the difficult things for those who are

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.600
 breaking in, whether it's physically, like the example you had mentioned, or

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.920
 digitally, like.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.200
 But fortunately, y'all are fucking the greatest because there's now many

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.920
 distributed distribution systems, D.secours, of course, right?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.640
 Anyways, back to this.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.160
 Imprecise and undisciplined technical execution, like you've got to be on point,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.040
 right?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.480
 You know, hacking and stuff is like you grind it.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.240
 They're doing it for the paycheck, nine to five, but we're all night online,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.440
 baby.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:15.720
 You know what I mean?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.120
 We just need to find that one mistake, right?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.880
 But the reverse is true because you also have to be 100% accurate 100% of the time.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.080
 And you might get away with it or so you thought, but years later, man, that log

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.840
 file or whatever the fuck they did, come get your ass.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.800
 So just be precise.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.480
 Persistent identities and crossing streams.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.360
 Crossing streams, OK, so I hacked this site.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.160
 I was, you know, using aliases tied to my name.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160
 I was young and I know what the hell I was doing.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.640
 But while at the same time also breaking into shit and then people are just

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.440
 obviously able to see two and two together because I did not

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.480
 compartmentalize my life and it was very easy for them to get.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 So you can't really do above ground and underground stuff at the same time.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.800
 I mean, you can, but we all have a little bit of multiple personality stuff.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.200
 But persistent identities.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.000
 During anonymous, I attempted to have multiple a dozen nicknames or something

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.080
 like that change at a different time and place, you know, and, you know,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.000
 if you do a hack, it's not really a good idea to use the same identity over and

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.640
 over and over again because you keep them guessing, right?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.120
 It's best to keep them guessing that they don't know.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.680
 Unfortunately, I was talking to an informant who knew all the nicknames

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.120
 anyways, or didn't even really matter in my case.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.840
 But that has to do with more of a choice about whether I chose to involve myself

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.560
 with a larger phenomenon and get involved publicly.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.960
 We'll talk more about the to crew or not to crew later.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.680
 Leaders, hierarchies and pyramids, right?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.200
 You know, we already know all that.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.240
 Ambiguous politics.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.960
 I would say it's nice to know who you're getting involved with and know where you

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.800
 stand and let others know how you would react to a situation politically.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.880
 Occupy Wall Street was the 99 percent, but then you'd also have like a lot of

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.440
 right wing tea partiers and even folks who believe that the cops are part of

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 the 99 percent too.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.640
 And so again, they had to wait until they got kicked out of a dozen cities by

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.480
 force by the police until they, oh, wait a minute, they're not on it, right?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.720
 No connection to local struggles.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.760
 Hacktivist actions are really, you can't just like parachute in and think that you

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.640
 know what a local struggle or those who are being oppressed by some type of

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.880
 corporation or government is going to do.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.120
 We're just going to come in and save the day.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.400
 You know, I mean, you really do have to understand the context and get involved

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.800
 to see what folks actually want.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.160
 This the synergy of activism hacking is at those little intersections of Venn

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.640
 diagrams is when you really are effective, though.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.040
 And it's there's in the United States is actually not that much overlap between

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.800
 hacking and from my personal perspective.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.720
 You know, I've been to those 26 hundreds and they they just ain't into it.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.320
 They're saying into it.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.240
 You talk talk about anti-fascism to be like, oh, that's good.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.800
 It's extremely real.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.000
 I don't do that.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.640
 Other problems, exclusivity, elitism, not sharing the knowledge and fun.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.600
 And like I'm a black head.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.200
 I understand.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.720
 Don't publish exploit code.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.840
 Don't keep it private.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.320
 I respect it.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.520
 But also like we can't keep this specialized and insular direct action.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.160
 We need to show.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.200
 And so like like Biela had said, Phineas and the Decepticons, I believe not only

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.840
 do they hack some shit and leak some shit, they've also published DIY guides

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.760
 to showing first off how easy it is and that you could do it yourself, that

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.520
 you don't need to wait.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.120
 Working within the system, you already know.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.120
 We ain't doing all that.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.720
 All right.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.120
 I just do this and mistakes are made.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.920
 I didn't really intend to talk in detail about how I was caught.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.520
 But I just do these couple slides here.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.920
 Just talk the tour correlation attack is with an informant.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.120
 But we'll talk about that later.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.720
 If you want to see me on a Saturday, come on.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.920
 We'll go on to how upset could go horribly wrong.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.720
 Here's some more fashion tips for the brave.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 This black so they reduce identifying.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.920
 This is more of a physical.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.120
 But it also I thought it might have some analog stuff too, because you know,

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 writing in these RSC chat rooms and publishing press releases.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.120
 I'm always curious to see how these intelligence agencies like use language

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.920
 analysis and so forth to identify and tie together stuff.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.520
 Or if you smash the window lately, well, like don't be wearing these the same

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.320
 sneaks that you'd be wearing all the time to catch your ass.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.120
 And they do.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120
 They do one mistake.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.920
 So this is right because these motherfuckers have mastered the counterinsurgency.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.120
 They know how to manage resistance and recuperate.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.520
 So and they did so.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.720
 With anonymous and a lot of it has to do with maybe a little weakness of the

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.320
 open nature of decentralized communities, right?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.320
 They have just these chat rooms with thousands of people, you know,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.920
 who's in their logging, of course, informants, of course, entrapment that

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.120
 we could talk a little bit about that as well later.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.920
 But they also try to discredit those who are working hard on the right shit.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.120
 They'll just go share co-option.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.720
 They'll try to I have a list down here.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.120
 The Dutch and formula, the divide and conquer other side of the coin are a few

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.720
 good papers that talk about some of the different things that they're doing.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.520
 A few good papers that talk about some of the different divide and conquer

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.920
 strategies, mostly between isolating good and bad protesters,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.920
 whatever the hell that means, or even try to reduce it to a narrative of law

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.120
 in order of criminality, like oh, we could have got to be legal or we have to be

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.520
 pacifist is the only way the one way or like that.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.720
 And so one of the strategies, they isolate the radicals.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.320
 They call us criminals.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.920
 They call us. But listen, what I found is that I was handing out flyers and

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920
 news will get my head beaten.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.720
 They still call me a terrorist.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.320
 I didn't even do that terrorist shit till many years later because they made me.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.120
 They made me a government corporate fascist co-opting the tactics and

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.920
 aesthetics of hackers and revolutionaries.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.720
 We're seeing this with QAnon like they're trying to say that is the

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.320
 type of lineage. There's obviously no lineage, but they like the aesthetics of

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.520
 rebellion and resistance.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.120
 I always think it's hilarious for right put rage against the machine as example

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.320
 because all these like anti-vax or right wingers and stuff might just hear it for

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.520
 the first time because you know, they only know what the hell to do it and they

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.720
 think that is then they wait.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.320
 These are commies. These are fucking lefties.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.520
 What the fuck is like, what the fuck Marjorie Taylor Greene was selling defund the FBI

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.520
 shirts right, but there's or right wing thinking that like they're now trying to

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.720
 claim the mantle of free speech and stuff like that because they got fucking

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.520
 kicked off at Twitter.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.120
 How about you fucking try a month in the box because you posted some shit on

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.720
 Twitter or how about you write a letter to your fucking judges sentencing and

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.120
 stuff like that.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.120
 They take your email privileges away for fucking months, right?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.520
 You know, try just doing handing leaflets and get your ass whooped and not these

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.720
 motherfuckers complaining about Twitter and stuff.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.520
 And then of course like Bielat had mentioned the hacked state and governments

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.120
 also are now adopting the hacking leaks themselves, right?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.720
 Full circle I suppose.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.720
 You know, there's a Vault 7 revelation showed how also the US CIA specifically

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.220
 has tools that could misattribute a hack and make it appear like it comes from

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.720
 somewhere else.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.520
 And then they try to muddy the waters too also with this Hunter Biden laptop and

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 the DNC and stuff like that.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.220
 So they're learning that some things are effective and in a way that it's a little

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.920
 bit more honest in a sense that they're not even they're dropping the pretense of

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.520
 law and order because democracy is a sham in the first place and now they're doing

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.320
 the same shit we are like at least in the United States they're just it's best past

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:05.920
 the breaking point.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.120
 Alright, just some critiques of leaking is not enough.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.820
 Like Bielat said, a lot of the work is honestly the journalism digging through

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.520
 the databases.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:13.920
 You know what I mean?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.520
 Like, okay, you could hack some shit and get like 80 gigs of emails and SQLs

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.020
 and stuff like that.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.120
 Like, you know, who has time?

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.620
 You know, when I was at my height, I had like hundreds and hundreds of targets,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:22.720
 man.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.820
 It's one of the reasons why I chose to go with WikiLeaks to release the Stratford

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.420
 emails because they had teams of professionals and journalists to be able to go through

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.520
 and look and find the stories to find the scandals because destroying is great.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.820
 I mean, believe it and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.420
 But leaking is kind of has a long-term scandals that could make or break a presidency

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.320
 or aspiring right-wing politicians career.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.820
 So deep-ancing the empire.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.920
 Can I give one example?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.620
 Yes.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:57.420
 In Lulsec, Peru hacked the government and they released emails that showed massive

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.720
 corruption and then they were voting to disintegrate the government and they didn't

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.520
 but they needed one more vote to do so.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.220
 So making a difference.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:11.120
 You could shape public perception and consciousness of the problem by exposing it.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.020
 And as outsiders, we're a little bit different from whistleblowers.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.220
 You know, I mean, I've never we're not military.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.120
 We're not law enforcement.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.320
 You know, I mean, we're they're holding all the keys like in their little fortress and

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.820
 stuff like that.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.520
 But again, if a smart person knows where to look to find the cracks in the windows and

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.620
 the doors, right and find that shit and release it.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.020
 Okay, leaking is not enough.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.020
 Lack of stable distribution platforms in the early days.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.220
 But fortunately now, I think a little bit is better now with Torrance and you know,

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.620
 a lot of the technology all developed.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.720
 A problem is over-saturation and desensitization.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.420
 So like in the early days, like it was a revelation that, you know, you have like a police

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.920
 chief email sending races stuff like that and you could get a fire.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.720
 But now there's just they're muddying the water.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.820
 But by dumping so much fake news and disinfo that is hard to distinguish reality.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.620
 And so now it's just a everyone's perception is, you know, we all know it.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.720
 Diffusion by disinfo limits whistleblowing.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.920
 So yeah, a lot of whistleblowers, you know, who work within like these governments and

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 stuff like that.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.220
 First off, we do need to create incentives because we do want to welcome those.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.520
 A lot of them do have like these once they see the dirt.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.420
 Maybe the few of them do join these things with the good intentions.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.220
 Maybe not police, bullies and so forth.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.180
 But nevertheless, maybe they have a crisis of conscience and we need to create welcoming

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.420
 environments to where they could we could embrace them.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.920
 But nevertheless, oftentimes I found that they have lingering allegiances and a belief

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.780
 that you could still appeal to the authorities by, you know, there's like whistleblower programs

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.820
 with the government like, oh, they'll protect you.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820
 But you know what?

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.660
 You know, look what they did to the ones who tried, you know, they prosecute and threaten

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.000
 and discredit and all the rest.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.320
 And so I found that that resulted in a lot of half measures.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.420
 And also, I don't remember if I talked, okay, I'll talk about it later.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.680
 And then liberal media is complicit as well because either they're not going to be covering

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.880
 it unless they have to.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.640
 Like for example, the Pentagon Papers, you know, or even Chelsea Manning went to several

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.160
 reporting agencies and tried to release them, but they weren't trying to hear none of that,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 right?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160
 So they're kind of part of the problems.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.800
 That's why we need like independent DIY journalism and stuff like that.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 This is where you all come in.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.820
 Unfortunately, leaking, I would say, has not stopped the death march because now that we

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.140
 are aware of it, we all know government is spying on us.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.360
 They're going to war and stuff like that.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.800
 So just the knowledge of this fact, we've all known that, right?

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.520
 So we need to make hacking a threat again.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.480
 Towards a more effective hacktivism, right?

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.240
 So you know, again, like we can all be the warriors.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.480
 I would say that is extremely important that you know exactly what you're looking at before

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.820
 you even get involved in it and also let those who are around you know what your limitations

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.680
 are before you get involved.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.360
 And then also, it's super important to practice prisoner solidarity for those comrades got locked

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.140
 up in the line of duty.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.020
 Now first, I want to shout out chaos camp because I got a lot of postcards from this camp years

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.600
 ago and it meant everything to me.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.600
 It meant everything to me.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:58.560
 I'm so, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here with you all.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.360
 I think they are still also doing a jailed to the mail thing.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.040
 I mean, if I was talking about, so there's still lots of folks locked up behind bars.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.540
 And I will say enacting prisoner solidarity is not as important also because it emboldens

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.440
 the next line of those who were willing to thinking about whether they take the adventure

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.680
 because you are not alone.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680
 You will have a movement that got your back.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680
 And we'll see you through.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.960
 We'll see you through the other end, right?

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960
 So study court documents.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.080
 You know, the discovery, the indictments, read that shit, study the forensic reports,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.640
 the advisers, see how they're caught.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.640
 I threw in here reject law and order, the framing of ethical hacking.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.560
 Yeah, we all know this shit, right?

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.680
 This is the big one though, know if and when to pull the trigger.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.400
 Like I alluded to it earlier, but you know, not always it's a good idea to release immediately

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.440
 or attack immediately.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.360
 For one, I would say this is one of the, when I first started getting anonymous and started

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.480
 looking at them, it was so amazing and inspiring because they're getting some big targets off

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.000
 the rip, but there's an IRC, OSHA, SQA, StateGov, Wendeface, Wendeface.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.160
 I was like, nah, you got to go through the emails.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.520
 You got to test all those hashes.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.440
 You know, you got to probe and get all the mails at least.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.120
 If you ain't got the mails, you know, before you pull the trigger.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.000
 But then again, you can't wait too long either because of course the window might close.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.240
 Less spectacle and more damage.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.160
 All right, now smashing a window, it shatters the myth of law and order and creates openings

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.080
 in which another world is possible.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.560
 But spectacle is great.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.920
 Defacements are great.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.520
 But man, why don't you just RMR off that shit?

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
 You know what I mean?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 Destroy that shit.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.880
 Stratford, it took them like six weeks because I deleted like four servers completely, DD

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880
 and shit like.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.600
 So a defacement that might take down, but damage is forever, baby.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.540
 Less redactions and more doxing.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.680
 So I put this in because I was kind of a little bit frustrated that for example, the Snowden

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.120
 dox that released all these slides of like the NSA slides and all the prisms and all this

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.120
 stuff, right?

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.840
 They didn't even release the names of the NSA agents or whoever fucking wrote them.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840
 Why the hell not?

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840
 Why the hell not?

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840
 Release that shit, man.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.160
 Like first off, in a lot of places around the world, police officers and stuff like that,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.520
 you should be known and we shouldn't have police in the first place.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520
 All cops are bastards.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.440
 But it would be a thing to know who they are.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.840
 So what are you so, but nevermind.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.240
 Docs their addresses and all that shit.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.840
 I will say though that you do have to go with the data because it's a lot of responsibility

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840
 to be sitting on.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.280
 I was hacking a lot of police stuff like that and I'd have emails and stuff like that.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.400
 And for example, they would have jail rosters of people who are incarcerated in these jails

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.480
 and people who are not even convicted of a crime for example, or also possibly victim

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.440
 witness statements and so forth of domestic violence that we don't necessarily want to,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.520
 obviously we don't want to expose that stuff because, so you do have a tremendous responsibility

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.560
 to parse through that data, which is again, a lot of the work when you hack some 80 gigs

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.560
 of emails and shit.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.440
 Oh man, I need a team for this.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.880
 But there's no crew, only you.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880
 Don't wait either.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.760
 But that's why there's like these networks.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.400
 We have these journalism networks and WikiLeaks and alternatives to WikiLeaks, how we do this.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.040
 And don't be afraid to be the first.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040
 Don't be afraid to go all the way.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.800
 I will say this, when I started getting arrested and something like, my first time I had 5,000

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.440
 credit cards, didn't use a single one.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.600
 I talked about using a little bit, oh we're going to donate to all these causes that they

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.600
 hate.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.960
 It would be great to charities and comic groups and stuff like that, but I didn't use them.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.960
 But they still charged me as if I did it anyways.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.480
 And they gave me the sentencing gullet, 5,000 credit cards, $500, two and a half million dollars

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.080
 in damages six years over the statutory maximum.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.880
 Anyways, come on man, they're going to sentence you as if you did it anyways, so you may as

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.880
 well go all the way.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.680
 Hell, half the time I've been arrested, half the time, yeah, you already know man.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.640
 And that's really all I have to say to be honest.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.640
 That's it.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.360
 We're down for questions.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360
 Please hit it.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360
 I'm an open book.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.360
 I'm here all week, so hit it.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:34.720
 So there's plenty of time for questions.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.400
 I will help moderate them.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.760
 Jeremy?

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:47.600
 Is there a microphone?

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:55.080
 Yeah.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.920
 Stand over here because we need to be in the camera shot.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:06.400
 Oh hi, I will never thank you enough for all you've done in your entire life.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:13.400
 I love you so much, both of you.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.400
 I have a short comment.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.160
 I'll make it short and I have a question for you.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.680
 We heard 2009, we heard Wikileaks name three times, we heard Vault 7, but you mentioned

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.500
 Wikileaks as a platform, a bunch of journalists.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.240
 My comment is that to me Wikileaks also taught the world how to do journalism and data journalism,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.760
 taught the world how to do anti-censorship publishing and not just a platform.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.240
 Also Wikileaks taught us about source protection.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.160
 Now I haven't heard the name of Assange in your talk and when the camp ended four years

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.600
 ago he was mentioned because four years ago he was fucking arrested and he's still in

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.400
 the worst prison in the UK for nothing today.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:00.640
 So I wanted to ask you, does this case of this violent character assassination campaign

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:09.600
 with this fake doctored accusations, the Niels Melser, the UN reporter, demonstrated that

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.320
 the Swedish rape case was fabricated?

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.820
 This and the rest, is that the same tactics to discredit, to divide and the such that you

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.800
 mentioned earlier?

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:27.440
 And is there a US bias in the perception of the character of Assange that prevents the

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.880
 unified and justified campaign of support that he and Wikileaks and everybody else in

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880
 Wikileaks deserves?

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880
 I could talk about the liberal media.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:48.720
 Well for one, for you Julian Assange and all political prisoners, all prisoners just saying.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.800
 Thanks for the question, it's a very heavy one, right?

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.600
 I will say this, it's true like we mentioned earlier that the United States especially

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.520
 uses the campaigns to discredit those who stand up, the nail that stands up gets hammered

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520
 down.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:08.760
 But it is also true that there is a history of patriarchy and sexual abuse that anyone

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.000
 is capable of doing it and it is disappointing and people need to be held accountable for

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 their...

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:23.340
 I can't comment on the specifics of the Assange, but I will say also that one thing I like

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.940
 about the new generation of whistle blowing platforms is that it is not necessarily centered

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.080
 around personalities or individuals, which that's why I mentioned earlier the martyrdom

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.000
 thing is that because it's a failure, we all fail, right?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.840
 And Wikileaks lists a lot of examples, I'm not even specifically referring to Assange

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840
 here.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:46.900
 So I'm just saying that it has a way of lessening the problem of these abusers in our organizations

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:52.240
 if we don't centralize power in that way.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:02.120
 And I could speak to the kind of bias against Assange in his case in the United States and

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120
 the liberal media.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.520
 I think you're absolutely right and I think it runs enormously deep for a couple of reasons.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:15.600
 I mean one of which is absolutely, you're right, that the American media in different

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.480
 moments of its history has been extremely spineless, completely spineless.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.480
 And in fact, the Citizens Commission to expose the FBI, the Washington Post published the

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.440
 story but they did not want to.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.720
 They did not want to, the New York Times didn't want to, a bunch of editors convinced Katherine

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.000
 Graham to release the information.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.520
 At the time that Wikileaks came into being, you had Chelsea Manning who wanted to show

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.160
 collateral murder, Reuters knew about that fucking video, they had seen it and they would

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.600
 not publish, right?

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.880
 And it was so important to have that platform.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:58.000
 And I think because in some ways, like if I was some Freudian, Lacanian psychoanalyst,

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.900
 which I'm not, I think there's something really interesting about how Assange basically showed

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.640
 how spineless the American media was.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.160
 Then things went sour, you know, and then it's insane to me because I've definitely

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.760
 have done events around Assange and you know there have been a lot of people who have come

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:22.760
 out and supported it but it's not receiving the attention it needs because that is a threat

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.120
 to journalism, he does not deserve that.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.360
 So I really appreciate your question and Wikileaks is a key part of the story that we're telling.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.960
 But yeah, absolutely in many deep ways.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.000
 I will say also that they tried to, you know, when they held me in contempt and wanted me

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.320
 to testify saying Assange was like, he asked you, he was paying you, whatever, he was like,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.760
 just because I don't necessarily agree with some of the Trump stuff earlier that I didn't

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.760
 agree with, but that doesn't mean I still said fuck you, I ain't saying shit motherfucker,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:59.680
 free the man, free the man.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:05.360
 We have five minutes, so questions, comments?

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.880
 We have a crisis of journalism that is we're almost past facts so nobody believes in anything

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880
 anymore.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:19.920
 So how can journalism still expose stuff if no one believes anything anyway?

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.680
 I think there is an objective truth.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.760
 You know what I mean?

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.480
 Despite their attempts to muddy the water with disinfo in this post-truth society, you're

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.540
 right, you're right, that's why I said leaking may not be enough.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.880
 That's why, you know, if you get the docs, post it, yes, and maybe we can and we should

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.560
 push hard to hold these people accountable once we find their information, right?

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.920
 But you're right because then they could also create a counter narrative that just makes

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920
 shit up.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.160
 So that's why I say just delete their shit or just stalk them outside of the house or

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.760
 do what you need to do, but they should not be around working military no more if you

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.080
 know what you know about them.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.760
 I also, I'm an anthropologist and we sort of, our bread and butter is conspiracy at some

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:02.520
 level and it's interesting because, you know, historically we tended to be like, oh, look

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:08.080
 at the chupacabra which is this like goat sucking alien in Puerto Rico which is where

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.840
 I'm from and I'm like, I love the chupacabra and it's really about colonialism and post

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.640
 colonialism and extraction and I will say that as much as I hate the far right and the

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.240
 right, I do actually think that part of the problem, again, I go back to like the liberal

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:29.680
 media and these sorts of things is that, you know, they haven't been historically aggressive

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.540
 enough going after the powerful, right?

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.320
 And so sometimes you get these conspiracy theories that kind of have like a kernel of

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.760
 truth, right?

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.720
 And so as you sort of rebuild journalism, you also have to like, you know, I got my

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.880
 vaccines and Pfizer helped create it, but Pfizer has done a lot of really fucked up

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.020
 things as well, right?

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.120
 And so we have to hold these corporations really accountable because I think that helps

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:02.760
 breed conspiracy as well and as kind of Jeremy said, like if you're not doing that, then

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.260
 that creates the conditions, but it's going to be a long time.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.920
 Obviously these have come in waves before, so I hope that we overcome the wave before

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.240
 we destroy the planet with climate change.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240
 That's my big worry now.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.240
 Okay, we have two more minutes.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:28.460
 We have one more question and we need to get that in those two minutes.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.760
 Can we take the two questions side by side and I'll just let...

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.960
 So I'll be quick.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.340
 Thanks to both of you for all the great work you've done.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.260
 Thanks for coming and talking to us.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.080
 You said that the postcards from here helped you while you were in prison and I was wondering

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.760
 because it was a long time, right?

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.760
 And what helped you carry through?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.620
 What else is helpful to do?

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.060
 And the second half of the question, now that you're out, are you completely free or are

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.540
 you still under some conditions and what is your life like?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.520
 What is your situation?

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520
 Right, thanks.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.520
 You're right.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.160
 So prison and jail is an extremely dehumanizing and isolating place.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160
 They're trying to break you.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160
 They're trying to break your spirits.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.160
 But one thing I've learned is that they can take your body, but they can't take your mind.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160
 It's that last inch.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160
 You're free.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:24.560
 And so being an isolating place, it's a whole world of fences and walls trying to separate.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.720
 It is a whole micro nation where they're basically second classes and stuff.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.880
 So I do a lot of political prisoner work and books to prisoners and support now is one

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880
 of my main things.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.320
 And what we're trying to do is we're trying to pierce that wall.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.480
 We're trying to climb that wall and reach out and make connections with folks to let

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.800
 them know that they're not alone.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.580
 It's a very despairing place.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.340
 And so just knowing that you're heard, for one, and just knowing that you got people out

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.040
 there that got your back means everything.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.400
 And so what I do, like you said, what conditions and stuff.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.120
 When I got out, I had three years paper and I was on this internet monitoring program

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.720
 where it's like a private company that I had to actually pay for all my devices that monitored

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.440
 my messages and stuff like that.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.080
 And actually to upload my messages every day and my PO would be like, "Who is this you're

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080
 talking to?"

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080
 It was terrible.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.200
 So that's why I've been out two years though.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.440
 And fortunately I had some lawyers who all the way supported me.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.000
 Shout out to Legal Aid, shout out to National Lawyers Guild, by the way.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.840
 And I'm sure you all have the equivalence because they've always had my back and often for free.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.840
 So in my case they actually fought the conditions on free speech and associate.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.720
 They said I couldn't even associate with hackers, couldn't even associate with civil disobedience.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.200
 What the hell that means, right?

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.000
 And it was like that the first time too as a matter of fact.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.600
 I still did what I did though.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.880
 But fortunately my lawyers did beat that with motions after we got the judges transferred

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.400
 over to Chicago and stuff like that.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.200
 One thing I'll say though is that I did two federal sentences for hacking and got arrested

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200
 dozens of times.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.200
 I don't regret any of it.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.080
 My only regret is that I didn't give a chance to finish any of the targets I was working

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080
 on.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.200
 So, can you do the reading quick?

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:03.080
 Because then I would take this as the last quick answer, quick question.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.240
 So if we're talking about hacking and leaking now, I'm wondering what you guys, obviously

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.800
 not ideologically, but what you think about ransomware groups and if you think that journalists

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.960
 or academics will touch the data that ransomware groups are leaking because they're pushing

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.680
 out gigabytes and gigabytes of data from big companies, what do you think about that as

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680
 a phenomenon?

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.400
 Yeah, it's interesting because I feel like I haven't monitored them as closely, but they

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.040
 certainly have changed their tactics where they're pulling back a little bit against

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.880
 like hospitals and then going against targets where they might hit a law firm that worked

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:37.200
 for Trump, take the emails and then DDoS secrets host them.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.720
 And I actually really respect what DDoS secrets is doing, which takes a kind of equal opportunity

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.520
 hosting the stuff.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.800
 They make some stuff public, some stuff they just give to researchers because that stuff

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.160
 is really, really important.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.080
 And there still isn't quite enough people going through this material.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.160
 And I also do suspect that ransomware groups are probably strategizing a little bit in

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.920
 terms of choosing targets that will help them monetarily, but maybe drawing a little bit

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.760
 of public sympathy as well.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.560
 But there is material out there, right?

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:19.080
 And I think having the public journalists, others really go through that stuff can yield

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.800
 some really, really important insights.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.560
 And that is something that many of us are well positioned to do today.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.400
 I just want real quick, I just want to say that I don't think we should necessarily knock

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.400
 criminal hacking or hacking for survival.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.720
 Those who as a means must learn how to scam copycars or credit card fraud just because

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.320
 if people are going to do what they have to do to survive.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.160
 When I was in jail and stuff, I didn't think myself no better or no less than anybody else

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160
 that was in there.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.280
 And frankly, the second time when I got out, I made a decision to go hard as possible I

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.640
 could and go after governments and all this stuff.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760
 It was like all gas, right?

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.760
 But I still got 10.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.920
 In the United States, that's actually relatively medium to low.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.920
 So there were 10s and 20s and 30s in life for people just wrong place, wrong time, they

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.080
 have to just survive and stuff like that.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.600
 So I'm a little bit humbled and not so like judgment about criminal hacking, which I think

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.960
 is still within our rubric.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.880
 So do what you got to do.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:23.360
 Okay, then thank the two of you for coming over here and actually giving the talk.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.240
 And ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy Annette, Biala Coleman.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:49.360
 Thank you.
