00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,760
 Okay, let's start.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
 I'm sure all of us are aware of the ongoing climate crisis.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,760
 That's no surprise here.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,560
 And we as individuals can only do so much to counteract the problems,

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,400
 as we all know, live with the big industries.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,280
 Hanno, here right beside me, climate scientist and a tea security researcher.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,200
 He will give us an overview of the challenges that those energy hungry

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,400
 industries face and hopefully how they can be overcome.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,080
 Give it up for Hanno.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:07,080
 >> [APPLAUSE]

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,920
 >> Yeah, hello, just a correction.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,320
 I'm not a climate scientist, but I'm like an journalist and

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,960
 write a lot about these topics, so yeah.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,760
 Yeah, I want to talk about the climate crisis and what we can do about it.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,600
 And like as an intro, I want to show you this graph,

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,880
 which is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
 And as you can see, it's going up.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,720
 And there's something important to understand here, and

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,680
 that is it will keep going up as long as we add more CO2.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,400
 Even if we slow down in adding CO2, it will still go up, and it will go up slower.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,760
 So, and the conclusion from that is like reducing emissions is really not enough.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,880
 We need to essentially stop emissions, at least from CO2.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
 For other greenhouse gases, it's a bit more complicated.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,640
 But for CO2, it's really, if we keep adding CO2, then it's gonna get warmer, and

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
 we will have more problems.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,400
 Therefore, essentially, we have to eliminate CO2 emissions everywhere,

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
 except maybe a few we might be able to compensate, but

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,280
 that's like really difficult and expensive.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,440
 So essentially, we need to look everywhere where there are CO2 emissions, and

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,400
 we need to get rid of them.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,560
 And when we talk about CO2 emissions, of course,

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,160
 we often talk about things like this.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,720
 This is a coal power plant.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,840
 This is very bad, and we should replace these with better types of energy,

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,480
 like something like this.

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,200
 And of course, I know there are complications with that.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,960
 We need storage, intermittency, etc.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
 That's not my topic today.

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
 I'm aware of it.

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,360
 But that's good to do that, but it's not enough.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
 Because it's not just about electricity.

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,160
 We have many other sources of emissions.

45
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,040
 And for example, we have productions, things like steel production,

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,720
 cement production, paper, plastics, aluminum, glass,

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,520
 aviation, shipping, agriculture, and a lot more.

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,440
 And the interesting thing here, or this is for each of these pictures here,

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,760
 I could tell you a story why it's really difficult to get rid of these emissions,

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,960
 why we will need new technologies to tackle these emissions.

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,840
 Unfortunately, I don't have enough hours to talk about all of them.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
 So I will just talk about two.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
 Yeah.

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,320
 So the first thing I want to talk about is plastics.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,080
 I mean, we often talk about plastics when it's about waste handling or

56
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,680
 microplastics, plastics pollution.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,240
 But the climate issues associated with plastics don't get talked about that much.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,720
 I think it's all because it's kind of a bit complicated, but

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,080
 that's what I want to explain to you and what we could do about it.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,120
 So we have, for example, things like this.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,600
 This is a steam cracker, which is one of the major facilities

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,640
 that produces chemicals that then are used to make plastics.

63
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,640
 They have a lot of emissions themselves, but

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,720
 there are other issues associated with it.

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,960
 So if you look at this in a bit more detail, so we have these steam crackers.

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,280
 And they run, at least in Europe, I have to say.

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
 It's different depending on where in the world you are.

68
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
 They run on something called NAFTA, which is made from oil.

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
 So you have oil drilling somewhere.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
 You get oil out of the ground.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
 It's a fossil fuel.

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,320
 Then you have an oil refinery,

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,800
 which kind of splits up this oil into different fractions.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,880
 And you get the usual stuff like gasoline for cars or kerosene for planes.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,880
 And one product these oil refineries also make is NAFTA,

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,320
 which is what plastics are usually made of.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
 This NAFTA is fed into these steam crackers.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,120
 They need a lot of energy themselves because they need a lot of heat.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,280
 It's around 800 degrees Celsius.

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,040
 That heat is also provided by fossil fuels.

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
 That is usually fossil gas.

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,560
 And that produces a lot of CO2 because when we burn gas, of course,

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,280
 that makes CO2.

84
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,000
 What comes out of these steam crackers are mainly the so-called olefins,

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,240
 ethylene, and propylene.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,760
 If there are any chemistry teachers in here,

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,440
 there are a lot of more things that come out of these steam crackers.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,960
 I try to simplify it as much as possible.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,440
 But these are the two most important chemicals that are used to make plastics.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,240
 And then there are further steps.

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:56,200
 But these steam crackers are actually the ones where most of the energy is used.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
 But we also have to think about something else.

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,680
 And that is what happens with the plastics after they have been used.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,960
 I mean, most plastics is things like packaging.

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,720
 It gets used maybe for a few weeks.

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,040
 And then it goes into the trash.

97
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,800
 And if you look at this on a world scale, then most of the plastics

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
 end up in landfills.

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,520
 Around 20%, 19% is estimated to go into waste incinerators.

100
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,760
 So it is burned to generate energy.

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,280
 Then there's this category mismanaged, which essentially means either

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,120
 you throw plastics into nature or you burn it in your backyard.

103
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,320
 That's not good, but that's what around 22% of plastics, what happens to it.

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,160
 And then there's recycling, which is on a worldwide scale around 9%.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,440
 I should say here that this differs widely depending on where in the world

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,960
 you look.

107
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
 For example, here in Germany, landfills are forbidden,

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,480
 and most of the plastics is burned for energy.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,720
 Now, maybe we wait till the train is stopping here.

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:18,200
 So no matter what, all of these cause emissions in some form.

111
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,920
 So if it's mismanaged, so of course if you burn plastics in your backyard,

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,880
 you really shouldn't do that.

113
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,760
 It's kind of illegal here.

114
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,760
 It causes CO2, because if you burn something that is made from oil,

115
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,200
 it causes CO2.

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,160
 It also causes, of course, air pollution and other bad things.

117
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,480
 But what you may not realize is if you throw plastics into the landscape,

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,720
 it's not just a problem because it may harm nature or may cause microplastics,

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,560
 but it can also cause emissions because these plastics can degrade,

120
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,440
 particularly under sunlight, and they can form methane,

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,400
 which is a highly active greenhouse gas, or ethylene,

122
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,280
 which is, if you remember from earlier, one of the things that plastics is made of,

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
 which is also a greenhouse gas.

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,680
 Then landfills are also a source of methane emissions.

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,960
 So one reason for that is that the same thing as if you throw it in nature,

126
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
 if you have plastics and you have sunlight, then it may degrade.

127
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,880
 But there's also an effect that in landfills,

128
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,320
 usually they don't have just one type of waste,

129
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,680
 but they have a mix of all kinds of things,

130
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,320
 and the plastics can lead to the organic content of the landfill

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,120
 to degrade into methane as well.

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,560
 So, yeah, there it gets a bit complicated,

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,120
 but also there are greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.

134
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,920
 Then waste incinerators, or I don't know, in Germany,

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
 you call them Müllverbrennungsanlage.

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,160
 Sometimes they are called waste to energy plants.

137
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,240
 Essentially, you're burning waste for energy.

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,520
 These have actually the highest CO2 emissions from all these things.

139
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,640
 And I kind of only really realized this when I researched this,

140
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,720
 that because in Germany, landfills are forbidden,

141
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,560
 and we're basically burning most of the waste,

142
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,800
 which is...

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,280
 And sometimes it's even...

144
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,960
 Waste incinerators are sometimes even considered as a type of green or clean energy.

145
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,800
 But they are the highest...

146
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,160
 From the greenhouse gas emission perspective,

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,400
 they are the highest emitting waste to treat waste plastics.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,640
 That's not to say we should go back to landfills.

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,920
 Probably not, and probably we don't have the space anyway.

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,840
 But it's an interesting thing to keep in mind.

151
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,840
 Yeah, if you do recycling that has emissions from the energy,

152
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,160
 this could be replaced by clean energy, and it's still kind of the best thing,

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
 because you're not just doing something useful with the plastic,

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,840
 then you're also replacing oil that is used for new plastics.

155
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,560
 Instead, you're doing recycling.

156
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,920
 So that's from all the not ideal options, it's the best.

157
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,160
 But how should we think of these plastic end-of-life emissions?

158
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,840
 And I really think the way we should think about this is that plastics are fossil fuels.

159
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,480
 Like, they're made from oil, they contain carbon.

160
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,920
 If you make new plastics, you add new carbon to the system,

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,600
 and that will eventually be turned into some form of carbon emissions.

162
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,960
 So really what we have to think about when we want to make plastics without carbon emissions,

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,480
 we need to tackle two things.

164
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,840
 We need to tackle the energy used to make plastics,

165
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,520
 and we need to tackle the feedstock, like what these plastics are made of,

166
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,560
 which is today usually oil or gas.

167
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,120
 And for the energy, we could think about doing electrification.

168
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,200
 Like, most of the energy needed is for heat,

169
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
 and heat can be generated with electricity,

170
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,680
 and then of course we have to worry about having enough clean electricity

171
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,640
 and having that reliably and in enough quantities.

172
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,920
 But it's a pathway one could go.

173
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:36,480
 So BASF is currently building the world's first electric steam tracker furnace in Ludwigshafen.

174
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,280
 They have announced last year that they started construction.

175
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,320
 I expect that they will soon announce probably that they have finished it and will start it.

176
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,440
 But that's currently the only one worldwide.

177
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,600
 And if you look at the numbers, don't consider these as super exact,

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,640
 because what they publish is...

179
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:07,040
 I had to compare yearly capacities with hourly, but it's roughly around 1.8%.

180
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,800
 So this is...

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,920
 Yeah, it's a start, but it's still a long way to go.

182
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:24,240
 This electric furnace needs around 6 megawatts of electricity.

183
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,080
 And if you calculate that, how much capacity they have there,

184
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,400
 and if you scale that up, that would be 350 megawatts,

185
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,880
 which is... I mean, that's a lot of electricity, but it's not inconceivable.

186
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,280
 Like, that's something you could imagine happening.

187
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,440
 So yeah, electric steam cracking, it's in early stages,

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,840
 but it appears that this is something that is kind of doable.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:57,400
 The real challenge is replacing these fossil fuel feedstocks, like what is in the plastics itself.

190
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,160
 And then one option to do this is there are a range of technologies

191
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,520
 that are sometimes called power-to-X or carbon capture and utilization.

192
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,560
 What this means is that you're taking hydrogen, which you can make in a green way.

193
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,240
 Today that's usually not happening, because today usually hydrogen is made from fossil gas,

194
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,440
 and that wouldn't make sense.

195
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,120
 But if we had green hydrogen in large quantities, and then we can take CO2,

196
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,360
 and out of these two gases, we can make all kinds of hydrocarbons.

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,680
 So that is what's usually called either power-to-X or carbon capture and utilization, or CCU.

198
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,760
 One issue there is, okay, then we need CO2, and where does this come from?

199
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,080
 You may say, yeah, that's easy, we take it from the next coal power plant.

200
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,640
 But I mean, we want to get rid of these coal power plants,

201
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,760
 and if we add the CO2 from the coal power plants in our plastics and then burn them later,

202
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,440
 then we'll have the CO2 from the coal later, so that doesn't really make sense.

203
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,520
 So in the medium term, you might use industrial sources that cannot be avoided yet,

204
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,000
 but in the long run, you basically only have the option to either use biomass,

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,720
 or you use the CO2 from waste, which I'll get to later, or you take it from the air.

206
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,320
 Taking it from the air is really expensive and requires really a lot of energy.

207
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,160
 Yeah, but these technologies in general require a lot of energy.

208
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,200
 Just making all this hydrogen is a very energy-intensive process.

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,920
 There has been a study a couple of years ago, which I'm citing here,

210
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:52,040
 that had estimated if you convert the whole chemical industry to such processes

211
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:59,400
 that take CO2 and hydrogen, then you would end up with something between 18 and 32 petawatt hours.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,520
 The wide range is depending on how optimistic you are about new technologies becoming available.

213
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,040
 But just to compare that, the world electricity consumption today in total is 22 petawatt hours.

214
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,040
 So you would roughly double the electricity consumption of the world

215
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,280
 if you convert the chemical industry to these power-to-X or CCU processes.

216
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,320
 And I also have some numbers for Germany here, like the German Chemical Industry Association.

217
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,120
 They had a report a few years ago where they came to more than 600 terawatt hours

218
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,640
 compared to, like, all of Germany uses 500 terawatt hours of electricity.

219
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,520
 They have a newer report where they have somewhat lower numbers.

220
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,080
 The main reason for that is that it's not really new technology or anything,

221
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,480
 but it is that they have lower expectations for the growth of the German chemical industry.

222
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,400
 And they looked at a few different technologies in that newer one,

223
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,520
 and the low number, like the around 300, that would only be if you have very high amounts of recycling

224
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,040
 and very high amounts of biomass on top.

225
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,920
 So if you're mostly setting on these CCU power-to-X technologies,

226
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,000
 then you end up with something like we would have to double the electricity production

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 and get the electricity production clean in the first place,

228
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,240
 and of course that new electricity should also be clean.

229
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,120
 So, yeah, then you may wonder, okay, can we make this more efficient,

230
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,200
 and are there alternatives to this?

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,760
 And now there are different types of these power-to-X technologies,

232
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,960
 and yeah, I'll go a bit into that in more detail.

233
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,400
 So this is like a slight modification from the picture earlier,

234
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,080
 where we have the steam cracker that gets NAFTA from an oil refinery,

235
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,880
 and then there's the technology which is called a Fischer-Dropsch synthesis.

236
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,280
 This has originally been developed to make oil out of coal,

237
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,880
 but it can also be used to make something like raw oil from hydrogen and CO2.

238
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,040
 So, and then we would basically just have this first step replaced,

239
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,880
 and the rest could roughly stay the same.

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,760
 I mean, we probably wouldn't want to make gasoline from that.

241
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,200
 I know in Germany there's a debate whether you should do that.

242
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,880
 It makes no sense, and it's only a debate in Germany.

243
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,800
 But for things like chemicals and also for things like kerosene for airplanes,

244
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,760
 which we should probably reduce, but we will have airplanes in the future probably,

245
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
 we might need to do this.

246
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,400
 But there's another way to go about this,

247
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,720
 and this is we'll have to look at China for this.

248
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,800
 So in China, there's kind of a chemical industry that is based on coal.

249
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,920
 Why? Because China does not have a lot of oil, and they have a lot of coal.

250
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,960
 So there's a technology called coal gasification,

251
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,920
 where you turn coal into something called syngas.

252
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,920
 That is not clean at all. It causes a lot of emissions.

253
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,560
 From there, you can go to methanol, which also causes a lot of emissions.

254
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,440
 And then there's a technology called methanol to olefins,

255
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,560
 which, as you might expect, turns methanol into olefins.

256
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,960
 So these things where we make plastics from.

257
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,000
 Now, you could imagine ignoring that thing on the left side

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,680
 and replacing it with something else.

259
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,080
 Green methanol is a facility in Iceland.

260
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,040
 It has been running since 2008.

261
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,560
 It was like the first green methanol facility.

262
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,120
 They are located close to a geothermal plant,

263
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,440
 which gives them heat cheap from the geothermal plant.

264
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,880
 It gives them CO2 from the geothermal plant, which is not widely known,

265
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,640
 but geothermal plants also cause CO2 emissions.

266
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,480
 And they have cheap electricity, with which they produce hydrogen.

267
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,560
 And so from the hydrogen and the CO2 and with the heat, they produce methanol.

268
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,360
 So this is technology that is in principle available.

269
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,280
 Still requires a lot of electricity, but it's something that exists.

270
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,760
 So, yeah, we could imagine having the picture before,

271
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,520
 but replace the left part, like we have green hydrogen, we have CO2.

272
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,640
 We make green methanol.

273
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
 Then we have this methanol to olefins process,

274
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,920
 which, of course, we also have to power by renewable energy.

275
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,240
 But that's also mostly process heat, and that's doable.

276
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,160
 And then we have these gases from which we can make plastics.

277
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
 Now, you may say, OK, how far is this?

278
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,320
 And interesting enough, there's this company from Iceland

279
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,800
 that I just showed you that had built this first green methanol plant.

280
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,920
 They have entered a collaboration with a Chinese company

281
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,680
 that is the biggest producer of these,

282
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 like the biggest operator of these methanol to olefin plants.

283
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,800
 So this coal-based chemistry for plastics.

284
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,040
 And they're starting to build a facility there

285
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,560
 where they use this green methanol technology

286
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,560
 to replace some of their methanol from coal.

287
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,560
 Now, I should say there are a lot of caveats with this.

288
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,120
 They are not using green hydrogen.

289
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,240
 They are using hydrogen they get from other processes.

290
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
 They are not using green electricity.

291
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,040
 So it's not a full-scale chain of green production.

292
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
 But still, this reduces emissions

293
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,040
 because these emissions from coal gasification are so high.

294
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,120
 And it's kind of interesting that...

295
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,280
 I mean, if you would ask me what I think is the most interesting project

296
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,360
 in decarbonization of the chemical industry,

297
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
 I would say it's kind of this.

298
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,000
 Like, there's nothing in Europe anywhere that's at this scale

299
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,240
 and that combines these technologies

300
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,920
 that could lead to a chemical industry

301
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,120
 where we eventually may get along without fossil fuels.

302
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,080
 So, yeah, we have two ways to go about this.

303
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,840
 One would be we create NAFTA from this Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,

304
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,840
 which we could call ENAFTA because we mostly use electricity.

305
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,120
 And we have steam crackers, which we electrify.

306
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,920
 Or we have green methanol,

307
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,520
 and then we have this methanol to olefins process.

308
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
 The methanol to olefins process is more efficient.

309
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,640
 So that's the thing from China.

310
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,400
 That's not me saying this,

311
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,080
 but that is written in a document

312
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,200
 that the German Chemical Industry Association published.

313
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,920
 And they kind of have an incentive to say it the other way

314
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,360
 because they have all these steam crackers.

315
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,480
 So I kind of trust that that's accurate.

316
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
 Yeah.

317
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,680
 And, like, these steam crackers are amongst kind of the biggest

318
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,960
 and most expensive facilities the chemical industry has.

319
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
 So this is something to think about.

320
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,560
 Like, we have...

321
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,080
 It's probably not the technology to move forward with this.

322
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,960
 Yeah.

323
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,640
 What other options may there be?

324
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,080
 So even if we have this more efficient process,

325
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,160
 it still requires insane amounts of electricity

326
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,000
 that are probably not plausible to have.

327
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,440
 Of course, and I really like to stress this

328
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,840
 every time I talk about whatever,

329
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,120
 we could talk about using less plastics.

330
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,680
 We should be aware of unintended consequences.

331
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,400
 Like, for example, if we replace plastics with something

332
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,840
 that is even more damaging to the climate,

333
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
 then that would not be a good idea.

334
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,440
 Like, usually it's probably not a good idea, for example,

335
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,720
 to use glass instead of plastics.

336
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,520
 There are also issues that reducing plastic waste

337
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,680
 can harm, like, durability of food and things like that.

338
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,400
 But in general, of course, if we can reduce plastics

339
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,240
 without negative consequences, that's a good thing.

340
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,800
 Then we could use biomass.

341
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 That's possible.

342
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
 The problem with biomass is...

343
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,200
 I mean, the good thing about biomass and bioenergy

344
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,160
 is that we can basically replace all fossil fuels with biomass.

345
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,800
 The problem is we don't have enough,

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,720
 and if we start growing biomass for energy or other uses,

347
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,640
 then that's usually not a good idea because then it needs land,

348
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,120
 and that land would probably be better left to nature.

349
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,040
 Some things like wetlands,

350
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,200
 or, like, if we have leftover land to grow plants,

351
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,160
 it's probably better to do renaturation or restoration of nature.

352
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,480
 So we can use biomass, but we should consider biomass

353
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,920
 produced in a reasonable way is probably limited.

354
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,440
 Then, of course, there's recycling as an option.

355
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
 As I said earlier, recycling rate currently is around 9% worldwide,

356
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
 but differs widely.

357
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,120
 There are countries that go, like, up to 20%.

358
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,000
 Sometimes you will hear much higher numbers.

359
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,560
 They are usually kind of cheating with how they're calculating it.

360
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,880
 But, like, if we would get, like, most of the countries

361
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,200
 to go to these upper levels of recycling,

362
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,080
 that would already be a massive improvement.

363
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
 The problem with recycling of plastics is that

364
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,680
 you need relatively pure inputs to do that

365
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,480
 because, like, you have different types of plastics,

366
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,680
 and if you have a mixture of different plastics,

367
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,480
 that cannot be recycled very well.

368
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,600
 There's a set of technologies called chemical recycling,

369
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,560
 sometimes also called advanced recycling,

370
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,520
 which goes from the idea that instead of just melting plastics

371
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,160
 and making new things out of it,

372
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,720
 you could break it down into more basic chemicals

373
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
 and then use these again to make new plastics.

374
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,560
 There are two major technologies in that area.

375
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,160
 One is called gasification, which is actually very similar

376
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,520
 to the coal gasification I was talking about earlier.

377
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,160
 The other one is called pyrolysis, which...

378
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,480
 And an interesting aspect here is I also mentioned

379
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,280
 earlier these two options with either steam crackers

380
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,760
 or this methanol-based technology.

381
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,760
 The gasification would be more compatible

382
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
 with this methanol-based process,

383
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,560
 and the pyrolysis, you would kind of want to have a mix

384
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,960
 because you get something which is called pyrolysis oil,

385
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,680
 which you could feed into a steam cracker,

386
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,160
 and you get syngas, which you could make methanol from.

387
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,680
 So, depending on which road you choose on these

388
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,080
 power-to-x technologies, it may make sense to choose

389
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,760
 a certain route of these recycling technologies as well,

390
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,000
 or you choose an intelligent mixture of both.

391
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,880
 These chemical recycling technologies

392
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,280
 are also quite controversial,

393
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,760
 and I think that's mainly because they have a bad history.

394
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,280
 I don't know if anyone remembers Thermoselect?

395
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,280
 That was like gasification technology.

396
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,240
 It was built in Karlsruhe and was a big failure.

397
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,880
 And there have been a number of projects

398
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,560
 where these technologies have been tried,

399
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,720
 and it seems relatively difficult to get them to work.

400
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,240
 Still, I think if this would provide a way

401
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,000
 to improve plastics recycling and recycle things

402
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,880
 that we cannot recycle now,

403
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
 it would probably be a good thing,

404
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,680
 and it should really be the goal from the waste

405
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,680
 to use as much as possible from the carbon inside the waste

406
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,120
 to make new products.

407
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,960
 But still, there will probably always be some waste

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,320
 that we cannot recycle.

409
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,920
 So, we will probably still burn some waste.

410
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,560
 But some things you could think about there is like,

411
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,960
 okay, we could take the CO2 and just store it underground,

412
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
 which is like carbon capture and storage technology,

413
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
 which you've probably heard of.

414
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,760
 I'm not gonna go into detail of that.

415
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,960
 That's also very controversial,

416
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
 and there are a lot of things to say about it.

417
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,120
 The other thing would be we could think about,

418
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,360
 okay, we burn the waste, then we have CO2,

419
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,960
 and we could use that CO2 for these processes

420
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,280
 that we talked about earlier, where we need CO2

421
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 to make new things like these Power2X or CCU processes.

422
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,840
 All of that is not so easy because when you burn waste,

423
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,360
 you not just get CO2, you also get nitrogen,

424
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,960
 and you get all kinds of other things

425
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
 because waste contains all kinds of things.

426
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,560
 If you burn it, it produces all kinds of things.

427
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,960
 So, you need to separate that,

428
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
 and this hasn't been done before.

429
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
 Like, there's currently no CCS or CCU facility

430
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,160
 on any waste incinerator anywhere.

431
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,080
 There is one under construction in Oslo,

432
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,920
 but they just stopped construction

433
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,960
 because they ran out of money due to inflation

434
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,480
 and cost increases.

435
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
 There is a project announced in Zellermeles

436
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,480
 where they want to use CO2 from a waste incinerator

437
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 for methanol production, which sounds interesting.

438
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,080
 I haven't found a lot of info about that project yet,

439
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,080
 but, yeah, I'd be happy if that works.

440
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,480
 Yeah, so to summarize this part,

441
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 yeah, we can make the chemicals we need for plastics

442
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,280
 from CO2 and hydrogen,

443
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,280
 but that would require enormous amounts of clean energy.

444
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,080
 This methanol to olefin technology,

445
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,480
 which is today mostly used in China,

446
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,680
 is probably more efficient than using the steam crackers

447
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,480
 that the chemical industry uses today.

448
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,480
 And using less plastics, using biomass,

449
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,480
 using more recycling, and maybe using new technology

450
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,480
 for recycling, all of that can help and can reduce

451
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,480
 the amount we will need with these crazy amounts of energy.

452
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,480
 Yeah, the second example I want to talk about is glass.

453
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,480
 Glass, of course, yeah, I mean, you know what glass is.

454
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
 We make bottles out of it, we make windows out of it.

455
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 Glass is produced in furnaces at very high temperatures

456
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 around 1,500 degrees.

457
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,480
 It varies a bit depending on what type of glass,

458
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 but in that range,

459
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 and that is usually produced by fossil gas today.

460
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 Okay, so it's mainly heat.

461
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
 Yeah, there are a few challenges with this.

462
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,480
 One of it is these need to be interrupted,

463
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,480
 operated without interruption.

464
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,480
 So many of these glass companies were very concerned last year

465
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
 when there was talk about,

466
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
 okay, maybe we will have gas shortages

467
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 and some industries will be cut off gas.

468
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
 That would basically mean you destroy a glass furnace

469
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,480
 if you stop running it.

470
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
 Like if you cut them off their energy supply there, that's it.

471
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,480
 Now you may wonder, okay, we mainly need heat.

472
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
 Can we use electricity and, of course,

473
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
 in the long run, green electricity to run that?

474
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,480
 But that's difficult.

475
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,480
 And it's actually not so difficult

476
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,480
 and it's actually not so hard to understand why.

477
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,480
 So if you have a glass furnace, you have to imagine,

478
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 yeah, you're melting some stuff into glass at high temperatures

479
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 and you're heating it from all sides.

480
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 And like replacing the heat from the side

481
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 and from below with electric heaters,

482
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 that's kind of doable,

483
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
 but then you also have a flame on top

484
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,480
 and that is you need to heat it from all sides

485
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
 so you get high quality glass and that it melts properly.

486
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
 And from above, that is kind of where the challenge lies.

487
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,480
 In 2008, a company in the US called Cameron Glass,

488
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
 they said they can do this.

489
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,480
 They can build a glass furnace purely electric.

490
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,480
 They did it in an area where there was a lot of hydropower.

491
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,480
 So this was kind of the first green glass production furnace.

492
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,480
 I have to say, there are electric glass furnaces

493
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,480
 that are like for special types of glass,

494
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
 but they are kind of small

495
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,480
 and they are not used for things like bottles or windows.

496
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
 Like the big ones are a challenge.

497
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,480
 So they tried this. It didn't work.

498
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,480
 So the furnace was unable to heat the glass properly and evenly

499
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 and there was a major accident.

500
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,480
 The molten glass leaked out. Luckily, no one got hurt,

501
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,480
 but it was a multi-day incident where fire brigades had to come.

502
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,480
 And this company filed for bankruptcy the year later.

503
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
 And I had written an article about this,

504
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
 like the question of how to decarbonize glass last year,

505
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
 and I talked to a few people from the industry

506
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,480
 and like everyone mentioned this thing.

507
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
 They tried this with electricity

508
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,480
 and that was kind of the incident for our industry

509
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
 where we got scared of this.

510
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 But then you can ask,

511
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,480
 "Okay, but can we maybe use mostly electricity and some gas?"

512
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
 And that is what the industry is currently trying.

513
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,480
 So there are two projects for hybrid glass furnaces,

514
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
 and I'm happy to say this here,

515
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
 because when I wrote about it last year,

516
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
 what I had to write was, yeah, there was a project,

517
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,480
 but it was cancelled because they didn't get the funding.

518
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 Now they got the funding from somewhere else.

519
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,480
 This is the first one here on the list.

520
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 These are our next-gen furnace.

521
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,480
 It's a glass company in Germany that they want to build.

522
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 I think they want to go 80% electric and 20% gas.

523
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,480
 There's another very similar project in Czechia,

524
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,480
 and they just got funding from the EU Innovation Fund,

525
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,480
 which is a EU program for major decarbonization projects.

526
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
 So these projects are on the way,

527
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,480
 and they will hopefully be realized within the next couple of years.

528
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,480
 Then, okay, we still have some gas left.

529
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,480
 We could imagine, okay, maybe we can replace that leftover gas with green hydrogen.

530
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
 That would be kind of the next step.

531
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
 And if we have enough green hydrogen,

532
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,480
 which by itself is a huge challenge,

533
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,480
 then we could decarbonize the energy supply for glassmaking.

534
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,480
 But there's still another problem, like even if we do that.

535
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,480
 So what is glass actually made of?

536
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,480
 So standard glass contains three main ingredients.

537
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
 One is so-called silica.

538
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,480
 That is not a problem.

539
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,480
 The other two are limestone, which is chemically calcium carbonate, or CaCO3.

540
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,480
 And the other is so-called soda, which is sodium carbonate, Na2CO3.

541
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,480
 Some chemical formulas. I hope nobody is scared of that.

542
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,480
 And these are called carbonates, and they contain carbon.

543
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 So what happens in the glass furnace?

544
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,480
 If you heat these things up, they turn into other minerals.

545
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
 So this calcium carbonate turns into calcium oxide, and that produces CO2.

546
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,480
 The sodium carbonate turns into sodium oxide, and that also produces CO2.

547
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:08,480
 And yeah, so the mineral inputs that are used to make glass,

548
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
 they contain carbon, and this causes emissions.

549
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,480
 And there's really no good solution for this.

550
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
 Like, okay, we can do recycling.

551
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,480
 Like, if we recycle more glass, then we already have these transformed chemicals,

552
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 and then we don't have these emissions.

553
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 But we will never have perfect recycling, so that can only go up to a certain point.

554
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,480
 Yeah, also maybe carbon capture and storage.

555
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
 I also asked the people from the glass industry.

556
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
 They said they don't think that's really workable,

557
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,480
 because if you wanted to carbon capture and storage,

558
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,480
 you also need CO2 pipelines and things like that.

559
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,480
 And these glass production facilities are relatively small,

560
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
 and they're relatively distributed.

561
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,480
 So that's kind of challenging if you want to get the CO2 and then store it somewhere.

562
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,480
 Yeah, so to summarize the glass making, yeah,

563
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,480
 making a fully electric glass furnace, that's difficult.

564
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,480
 We may be able to have mostly electric hybrid furnaces

565
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
 that run with green electricity and green hydrogen,

566
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,480
 and that could decarbonize the energy supply.

567
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,480
 But there's really no solution yet for these emissions from these minerals or carbonates.

568
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,480
 Yeah.

569
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,480
 More general conclusions from my talk.

570
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,480
 And this is really the message I want to get across.

571
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,480
 Like, if we want to fix climate change, or whatever you want to call it,

572
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,480
 basically almost every industry needs to change.

573
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,480
 They need to change their processes in major ways to avoid emissions.

574
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,480
 And many of these are really in early stages.

575
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
 Like, we have ideas how to do this.

576
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
 Maybe we have pilots.

577
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
 Maybe we have early stage developments.

578
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
 But a lot of that has really not been tried in larger scales.

579
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,480
 Yeah, that's what I just said.

580
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
 Yeah, and that's also like a big message.

581
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
 We will need a lot of green electricity to make that happen.

582
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
 I mean, looking at it from a place like Germany,

583
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,480
 we probably won't have all that green electricity.

584
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,480
 We will also have to think about what can we import.

585
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
 Like, if you think about these chemical productions,

586
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,480
 maybe we can import green methanol and then...

587
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
 Yeah, but that's really like...

588
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,480
 We need enormous amounts of clean electricity,

589
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,480
 and I think that's not really realized at the scale that it will be necessary.

590
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,480
 I also have a small advertisement blog,

591
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,480
 because earlier I said there are all these other things I could also talk about.

592
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,480
 And of course you probably want me to talk about that.

593
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,480
 I want to try doing talks like this, but for the internet on YouTube.

594
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,480
 You can subscribe there.

595
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,480
 And I also write a newsletter where I write about these things.

596
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,480
 I've written, for example, about some steel decarbonization and cement and things like that.

597
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,480
 Yeah, if you want to subscribe there, I also have flyers with the URLs,

598
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,480
 so yeah, take that if you're interested.

599
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,480
 And yeah, I think we have some time for questions.

600
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:39,480
 Yes, thank you very much, Hannu, for that very insightful talk.

601
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,480
 [Applause]

602
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,480
 So yes, we have about six minutes for Q&A.

603
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
 Do you have any questions? And please raise your arm.

604
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,480
 We have a very friendly and highly visible angel who will bring a microphone.

605
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
 Yes, please.

606
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,480
 Hey, at the beginning you had the slide with many, many, many processes.

607
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
 Yeah.

608
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
 And you took two now out of them.

609
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,480
 Which of them is the biggest one?

610
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
 How is the percentage of the energy consumption?

611
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
 Steel is the biggest from the amount of emissions.

612
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,480
 Steel is like 12% if you add the electricity that you need for the steel,

613
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,480
 and 7% if you only look at the steel plant itself.

614
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
 Next question, please. Yes.

615
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:33,480
 Yes, you said that a lot of clean energy is needed to do this decarbonization of the industry.

616
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:41,480
 But what about mining? What about all the stuff we need to build all this clean energy?

617
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
 Is that even possible?

618
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:50,480
 The mining is not as much of a problem as people tend to think.

619
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
 So what you need to realize is that if you look at mining today,

620
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,480
 what we're mining is mostly coal and oil and gas.

621
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,480
 So if we go to clean energy, we will mine a lot less.

622
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
 We will mine different things.

623
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
 We will need new mines in new locations.

624
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
 All of that has challenges.

625
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480
 But there have been a few studies.

626
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,480
 There isn't really any mineral or material where there's a major shortage

627
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
 or where you couldn't imagine doing that mining.

628
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
 And really I think this is an important message.

629
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,480
 The amount of mining will be reduced if you go to clean energy.

630
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
 Okay, back there, please.

631
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,480
 Thanks for your talk. Thanks for your explanation.

632
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
 My question is what about degrowth?

633
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,480
 So is it really realistic to think that we can keep all the industry that we have

634
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
 and we can just keep producing if we solve the problem of carbon emissions?

635
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,480
 Yeah, thanks for the question.

636
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,480
 I mean, you noticed that at some point I mentioned using less.

637
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
 What about this degrowth question?

638
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,480
 The way I think about it, so my problem is that often it seems these debates are

639
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,480
 either you want degrowth or you want technology.

640
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,480
 I think we should use all the technologies that make sense.

641
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,480
 And then we should look at them and look at the things that are really difficult

642
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
 and probably reduce those.

643
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:29,480
 And to say it, I think the most difficult things are chemicals like plastics and aviation.

644
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,480
 Like these are where you come to these really enormous amounts of energy needed.

645
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,480
 And I think for aviation that's the most controversial one probably.

646
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
 Are there any more questions?

647
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
 Oh, yes, right in front here.

648
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,480
 The microphone is running.

649
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
 Yes, please.

650
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,480
 If I've seen it right, you have green hydrogen in all of these processes, right?

651
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,480
 In the ones I talked about, yeah.

652
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 So CO2 neutrality won't be happening without green hydrogen.

653
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,480
 Where will this green hydrogen come from?

654
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,480
 I mean, you mentioned that because we are in Germany.

655
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,480
 In Germany we have a very specific party and they are talking about green hydrogen for cars.

656
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,480
 Ignore that one for a second.

657
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,480
 Yeah, it's a challenge.

658
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,480
 I could give another talk on that.

659
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,480
 So the issue with green hydrogen, I mean, first of all it requires a lot of energy.

660
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,480
 So we could think about doing that somewhere where we have a lot of sun,

661
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,480
 like in Australia or somewhere in Africa.

662
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,480
 The other problem is transporting hydrogen is really difficult.

663
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,480
 For example, I don't see shipping of hydrogen happen.

664
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,480
 That just doesn't make sense from the amount of energy you lose with that.

665
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:01,480
 And then you could come to this idea that maybe we should talk about where to produce what

666
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:08,480
 and think about maybe we should make steel in Australia or in Africa.

667
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,480
 But if you say that in Germany then someone shouts deindustrialisierung and then the debate gets difficult.

668
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,480
 But I think we need to talk about this.

669
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
 All right, there's another question right here in front.

670
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
 Yeah, one very practical thing.

671
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,480
 You said in a side note that it's probably better to use plastic bottles instead of glass bottles.

672
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,480
 Could you elaborate a little bit on that?

673
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,480
 I mean, we like ditch plastic bottles so we do glass bottles.

674
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,480
 But what's it with when we have plastic bottles we reuse?

675
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,480
 Yeah, I mean, reusing a bottle is always better, right?

676
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,480
 It doesn't matter what it's made of.
