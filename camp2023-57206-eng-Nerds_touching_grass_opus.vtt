00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 Now I'm really, really happy to announce Julian.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 Julian is going to talk about biohack spaces and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.120
 is going to share their knowledge on them with us.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.600
 So please give a warm welcome, big applause to Julian.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.480
 >> Hi, okay.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 That went faster than I thought.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040
 Hi, I'm going to talk about biohack spaces.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.240
 This might be a little rushed because originally I had much more time in mind

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.120
 when I applied for the talk.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 I'm going to quickly tell you who I am.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.960
 I'm going to give you a very brief, like 120 seconds history of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 how the hackerspace movement got its traction 16 years ago.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 And then I'm going to go into biohack labs,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 especially in the curious community labs, which I am a part of.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.440
 Talk a little about our projects.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.360
 And then I'm gonna tell you why this is all important and very dear to my heart.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.920
 Who am I?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.840
 I'm Julian.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.000
 Today I like to use they and then pronouns.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.880
 I'm 42, but I really don't have any answers for you.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.600
 I live in Hamburg and I'm part of the Curious Community Labs, which we founded

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.760
 in 2020 out of a group of people who had been doing DIY biology before.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.800
 And I've also been part of the CCC for 20 years this year.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.520
 History of hackerspaces, and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.720
 I think this is sort of important to know your roots.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 In 2007, who of you has been, went to the camp in 2007, or

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.360
 who of you has been around in 2007?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 In 2007, there was an inflection point because

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.160
 there was, after the camp of 2007, there was a tour of European hackerspaces.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520
 And a bunch of American hackers, most notably Dan Kaminsky,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.600
 we all dearly miss him, Nick Farr, Bree Petters, Mitch Altman,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.360
 a couple of others, did a tour around European hackerspaces and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.280
 visited the C-Base, MetaLab in Vienna, and Tropia in Karlsruhe,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.560
 Chaos Computer Club in Cologne, which was sort of the biggest and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.880
 most notable hackspaces around at that time.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.200
 And Joel and Poulon did a talk about hackspace blueprints.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.920
 And out of that came a whole explosion of hackspaces.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.600
 After that, NYC Resistor was founded in New York,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 a noise bridge in San Francisco, and just, I don't know,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.080
 about 50 different hackspaces within the next 18 months.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.120
 So this entire explosion of hackspaces and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.640
 everything that has trickled down from there is sort of due to the camp in 2007

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.960
 somehow, and due to these people I would like to give a shout out.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.760
 And also a shout out to the original sort of European hackspaces like C-Base and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.120
 MetaLab and Tropia, C4, and obviously don't forget the roots in the US as well,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800
 like Loft and others.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.400
 The world is very different today.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.800
 The whole entire movement has changed, hackerspaces have changed, but this is,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.800
 I think it's quite important to know your roots and also understand that

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.840
 small inflection points really can start a movement and can inspire others and so on.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:50.800
 I, after about 17 years in the hacker community in 2020,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.200
 started being very interested in growing my own mushrooms.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 And out of that sort of started joining the biopunk movement,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.000
 which I'm going to quickly sort of give you an overview of what I mean when I say

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.480
 that we very much about DIY grassroots biology, and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.200
 I understand that grassroots is a really funny word here.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.960
 We are very diverse and not entirely definable.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.600
 And just as you can't really grasp what nature actually is,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.000
 there's people doing stuff with DNA, there's people growing mushrooms,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.440
 there's people going foraging, picking stuff, fermenting,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.480
 playing with yeasts, inventing new foods, everything around that.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.520
 Very diverse, there's all sorts of projects all around Europe,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.600
 but very few actual dedicated biohack spaces.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 We are curious about biology, we're curious about open source and sharing and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 teaching and learning just as well as the electronics and computer based hack scene.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.440
 Some of us focus more on fungi, others on microbiology.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.480
 In Hamburg, we're very sort of fungi-focused group, but

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.560
 we also do a couple of other things.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.880
 And we're sort of separate from what someone might understand as the sort of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.800
 old school biohacker body modification kind of scene.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.360
 People who work with their own body and try to optimize, and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.800
 so it's not really the same kind of people in any sense.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.680
 What we are more closely to is sort of the solar punk movement,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.240
 people are thinking about being autonomous, going off grid.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.800
 These kind of people, and then obviously we are sort of intertwined with the hacker

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.560
 movement as well.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.760
 In Hamburg, we founded the Curious Community Labs, we have 42 square meters.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 We have some extra areas, it's all in the Oberhafen in Hamburg.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.480
 If you ever come by, please have a look at us.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.840
 If you live in Hamburg, please come visit.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.720
 We have 23 members, and those numbers aren't made up, neither the 42 nor the 23.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.320
 And we have a bunch of gear standing around that we can use to do our own

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.680
 DIY biology.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.200
 Some is very new, some is sort of foraged from industry,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.160
 from companies throwing out old hardware, and we give it a new life.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.480
 We grow mushrooms with a Flowhood, which is a sterile workbench.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.920
 We have a big massive autoclave, we have grow tents.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.480
 We have, someone sponsored us some DNA sequencing hardware.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.920
 We got a big grant to build the Garden of the Future,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.080
 which has a massive weather station and a greenhouse.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.400
 And we're certainly not the only biohack space around, but it's sort of hard to

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.840
 grasp, and there's not really this sort of website collecting everything,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.760
 like there's on hackspaces.org.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.760
 So if you are part of your own biohack space, please contact me afterwards,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.520
 I'm happy to network.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.280
 There's a bunch of people around Berlin as well.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.440
 There's obviously online, there's a couple of groups and

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.800
 people being interested in different topics.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.320
 Our lab looks a little like this.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.600
 There's also a bunch of equipment standing around that and

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.000
 stuff that you can't see because it's sort of distributed.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.960
 And we have a bunch of projects.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.960
 Currently, most prominent is the Stadtpilze, or city mushrooms,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.720
 which got sponsored by the city of Hamburg.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.320
 We do some mushroom lamps, we build the Garden of the Future,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.400
 as I just said.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.880
 We go on foraging trips, we do food experiments and

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.600
 experiment with all sorts of new ideas of ways of fermenting things and

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.080
 growing yeasts and inventing new ways of doing things with

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.000
 combining mycelium with grains.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.320
 And then we also have people who build a little company building

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.880
 acoustic absorbing mycelium based composite materials and so on and so on.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.080
 So it's very diverse, and I really have to rush through there a little,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.560
 because I'm going to end the project a little more in depth now.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.320
 The Stadtpilze is basically idea of taking a bucket that you can get at

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.440
 any restaurant you like, because they throw them out.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.680
 Filling it with cardboard, with coffee grounds,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.200
 with different other substrates, straw, and so on and so on.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.280
 And we built this whole brochure that makes it very accessible for

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.640
 people to grow their own mushrooms.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.080
 And this looks like, come on, this.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:20.120
 Which is a pink oyster mushroom, which you can then grow yourself

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.840
 on your windowsill and eat, and it's very delicious.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.560
 So being sustainable about your own food is sort of one part of what motivates us.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.440
 Then we work with novel mycelium based materials, most notably the mushroom lamp

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:45.160
 which Matti built, which is a, and I'll show you how this stuff is made in a second,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.040
 but it's basically, it feels a little like polystyrene.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.160
 It has sort of a light weight, but it's very firm, and you can use it.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:03.040
 It's 100% biodegradable, and it is built out of straw and buckwheat and mycelium.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.800
 And then this becomes a lampshade.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.000
 We grow mushrooms.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.560
 We have our own grow tent, which looks about a little like this.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.200
 And we do this in a sterile work environment, so you need a flow hood or

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.680
 some other way of keeping your environment sterile.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.040
 This puts pressured air through a HEPA filter, so

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:31.520
 you disinfect obviously, but that allows you to keep the stuff clean.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.440
 I don't know if Sebastian is around?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.680
 No? Okay.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.720
 Sebastian has the project with building a planktoscope,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:45.960
 which is a high speed photography plankton analyzing water and

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.920
 seeing what lives in there, and with raspberry pie and some high speed photography.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.320
 I think 8,000 pictures per second, and then you can see what flows through there and

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.800
 what is actually in there, and count what is in there.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.920
 We have group activities.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.960
 We go out and forage mushrooms and prepare them and also learn about them,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.840
 understand how to identify them, etc., etc.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.880
 We go out into nature, which I know for some might be scary, but

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.400
 we actually love to do this kind of stuff.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.520
 And then I'm going to talk a little about my own little project to

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.120
 illustrate a little more what can be done, and

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.480
 also because I know the most about what I do myself.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.880
 So last year I started playing the trumpet again,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.400
 which had been a hobby when I was like a child.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.240
 And then I stopped and then I started playing again, and

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.360
 I live in the middle of the city.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.320
 So obviously my neighbors are not too happy about this.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.520
 Now, you can buy mutes and stick them in the trumpet, but

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.920
 they restrict the airflow and that's sort of not really fun.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.840
 Or you can buy these things for about 500 euros, which is sort of a barrel

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.720
 with some sound insulation, and you play inside and it's quiet and

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.960
 nobody gets disturbed and it's quite nice, but it's also 500 euros.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.960
 And these things are made of plastic and not entirely great.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.400
 However, I still bought one because I needed one urgently.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.800
 And then I thought, well, I think I can make this myself.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.160
 So act one, I got myself a metal barrel and cut off the top.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:24.000
 Act two is that I 3D printed a mold that I could use to create

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.960
 the waveform that reflects sound.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.080
 Act three is that I grew a bunch of mycelium.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.880
 And the way you do this is you take some carbohydrates like rye,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.720
 you sterilize it, you inject some liquid mycelium or spores in there.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.080
 You let it grow under good conditions and

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.560
 then you mix it up with some substrate.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.280
 For example, in my case, I used rapeseed straw and

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:02.120
 I used buckwheat shells and I mixed them in a two to one relation and

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.200
 mixed it all up with mycelium and then I used reishi mushroom,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.000
 which is a medicinal mushroom.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.120
 But it also has incredible propagating properties,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.000
 like this stuff grows like crazy and

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.920
 it's very hard to get any molding or rotting in there.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.960
 So I used that and then I shredded it all and ran it through a clean shredder.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.480
 And then I placed it all together and

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.920
 placed it all together and let it grow for about a week.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.520
 And then I had this and then I took out the mold and then I dried it and

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.720
 now I can play my trumpet into this and it is 100% compostable.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:51.560
 It is completely DIY and it also keeps my neighbors from complaining.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.360
 So that is what I built this winter.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.040
 So you can have a lot of fun and there's a million of applications of growing your

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.320
 own mushrooms, of understanding nature around you, building your own food,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320
 working with different kinds of components.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.840
 Also building tools and software and

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.680
 hardware to help to make this even easier and

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.320
 create less, what do you call it,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.040
 you don't have to throw that much away, for example.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.240
 Or understanding more about the strains you're building,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.000
 and microscopic stuff, organizing the different samples, etc, etc.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.760
 So there's a bunch of things to do and it's incredibly fun.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.240
 And I have only been at it for, if you're honest, about two years.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.520
 So there's a very, very steep learning curve in just doing your own stuff and

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.120
 understanding a little more about what surrounds you.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.240
 And that's why I think this is important.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.040
 First of all, this planet is burning and this is very urgent.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.760
 We need to find solutions.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.600
 And we need to find big solutions but also small ones.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.280
 And we need to do this urgently and

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.560
 without the sort of belief that capitalism can save any of this.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.040
 We need to go in there and do little quick projects to iterate and

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.560
 to share our knowledge and to become more resilient.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.000
 We need to learn to grow our own stuff.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.160
 And we need to learn how to forage and preserve food and make it delicious.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.480
 And go out into nature and understand what surrounds us.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.320
 I think the idea that we are somehow as humans separate from nature is a deeply,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.400
 deeply patriarchal, colonialist, extractivist idea and this has to change.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.480
 We are not in any way separate from nature.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.480
 We are very much part of nature and we need to understand what surrounds us.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.880
 If we still believe we can somehow force nature under our will,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.720
 we will go under.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.640
 So please decolonize yourself.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.560
 Please understand that the idea of somehow conquering the world is a really,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.840
 really, really dreadful one.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:26.320
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.840
 >> Thank you.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.880
 And now you, hackers, people who are interested, we need you.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.640
 Many projects that we do require knowledge of computers and electronics.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.600
 Require an understanding of physics and mechanics.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.960
 And there's so much to discover and learn and share.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.040
 And there's so much fun in this because at the end, often it's very delicious as well.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.520
 And, or useful, or anything.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.320
 And it, you know, what we do usually is very, very sustainable.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.280
 Doesn't require shipping parts from the other part of the planet and

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.000
 then throwing them out because you, you know, did the wrong solder.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.040
 You can't, as I said, you can't change the fundamental laws of nature.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.160
 But if you really start listening, nature can start changing you and

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.360
 that is what we need as a society.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.560
 So please join a space, start your own, talk to us,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.840
 start doing some in your own hack spaces.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.480
 We offer some support.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.640
 We offer network.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.400
 We are open for networking to others.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.480
 You know, you can just reach me.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.960
 You can reach me after the talk.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.800
 You can go to our website, curious.bio.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.080
 You can write to me.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.920
 You can talk to me.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:52.160
 And I rushed through all of this to have two and a half minutes of questions.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:52.680
 Thank you.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:01.480
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.920
 >> Thank you so much, Julian, for

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.360
 sharing your experiences and showing off this great mold you grew.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.200
 So if you have any questions, there is a wonderful angel with a microphone that

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:21.200
 is smaller that you can go to and queue and ask maybe one or two questions.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.360
 So please shoot.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.280
 >> Hey, curious if you're doing anything with genetic engineering or

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.400
 trying to figure out how to get approval to be allowed to do that within

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.080
 the European Union.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.040
 >> No, we don't do it.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.520
 I know there's projects who do this kind of stuff.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.520
 It is obviously dangerous.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.240
 It also requires a shit ton of equipment that we do not have.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.400
 I have no idea about the approval.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.640
 That's why we grow mushrooms.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.200
 I mean, there's also a huge, most of the stuff we do is patented, so

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.640
 you can't actually commercialize it.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.320
 But you very much can do your open source version of it.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.360
 And that's sort of for now.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.840
 I know there's some projects, but we don't.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:12.960
 >> Hello, how resistant is this material against humidity and this kind of-

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.680
 >> Humidity, not so good.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.160
 Fire, quite good.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.160
 I don't know the exact specifications, but there's been a paper on fire

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.120
 resistance and it doesn't burn, it just smolders, so it's decent.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.480
 Yeah, you don't want to put this stuff in your basement or outside.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.720
 That's just not, it's going to draw water.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.120
 And it needs to dry.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.720
 You need a drying chamber because it dies, the mycelium dies at 70 degrees.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.960
 So you need to get it to 70 degrees, often dry it for a while to get it really dry.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.320
 But once it's dry and it's in your home, it's great.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:57.000
 And if it's a little moist in your home, it'll just absorb moisture and

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.920
 then just let it go once it stops being moist.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.720
 >> You almost answered my question already, but 70 degrees, that's centigrade?

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.160
 >> Yes, yes, 70 degrees centigrade.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.960
 >> What do you think is the density?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.000
 Is it more like styrofoam, like very light, or is it more like cardboard?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.120
 >> It's more like polystyrene.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.400
 It depends on the, on very many factors.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.360
 You can tweak this.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.080
 You can play around with the substrate composition.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.080
 You can, the longer you let it grow, the denser it becomes, so

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.760
 you have to stop it at a certain point, etc., etc.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.960
 So it really depends on what you, on what you, yeah.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.080
 >> And tweak it up and down.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.400
 >> You can tweak it up and down, yeah, you can totally do that.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.640
 >> I was wondering if there's a way to get more specific details on how to make

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.400
 the audio tunnel?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.240
 >> On, yeah, it's, yeah.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.800
 >> There is, okay.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.640
 >> It's a 3D model I built basically by asking around on the Internet and

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.480
 figuring out and asking, actually going on YouTube, seeing something similar,

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.000
 talking to the guy who made the tutorial and asking me how he did it, and

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.600
 he did the tutorial for me.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.440
 >> Okay, so it's all accessible online essentially.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.280
 >> Yeah, sort of.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.240
 I'll talk to you later.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.740
 >> Thank you.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.000
 >> We're done?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.200
 Thank you very much.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.880
 >> Oh, a question.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.440
 >> Yeah, but we are, we are over time.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.080
 Okay, here's the question.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.400
 >> Yeah, I just have a question to connect with people.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.200
 I'm looking for experienced people who have experience in DIY

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.520
 hormone production for HRT.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.960
 So if you want to find me later, I'm at Art and Play over there, and

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.960
 I will stay here a while and also post it on a bulletin.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.720
 >> That is super important.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.560
 I know there's a couple of projects around there.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.800
 There's none where we do, but I know this is a very, very important thing.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.600
 >> Just because it's biohacking here.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.120
 Yeah, thank you.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.160
 >> Hormone replacement therapy.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.040
 >> Replacement therapy, often for trans people, but also for women and menopause.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.540
 Yeah.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.360
 >> Okay.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.080
 >> I'll answer your question after the talk.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.240
 Thank you very much, everybody.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.600
