00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Ask the Teams here at Chaos Communication Camp 2023.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 With me on stage today are two members of the NOC, the Network Operating Center.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We have Will H. and Nico Duck.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And we'll talk about what the NOC actually is, what they do, etc. etc.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 To give a little bit of an impression of how much work goes into getting Internet to the camp and to the people here into the tents.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 So let's start with the team.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 What Network Operating Center or Internet Manufaktur?

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Which name is it?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Kind of both of them. Hello everyone.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Most of the times are called the NOC, but on the radio you can't really distinguish between NOC, VOC, LOC, POC and everyone else.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So we prefer to be called Internet Manufaktur at least on the radio.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And it sounds a bit better and sounds more like what we do here.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And how many people are we? How big is the team?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 The team is about 30 people actually.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We mostly work in English because we have a lot of people from different countries, from the Netherlands, from the UK, as well as just Germany.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So we're a slightly different team, I think, in Chaos Events where we're working really nearly always in English.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 All right. And the size of the team, of course, varies during the event.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So a few people during build-up and then gradually increasing until...

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Yes, yes. All of the work is really in advance of the event and in build-up and tear down and not less during the event itself.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Unless something breaks.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Exactly. And things do break, yes.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Well, it's the outdoors.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yes, yes, exactly.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So at a Chaos Event, at a Hacker Event, Internet is, I think...

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You could argue, is it more important than water and waste water, but it's one of the higher priority items.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So how do we get the Internet to the camp? How does that actually work?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Because we're in the middle of nowhere, basically.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Yes, so actually this year we actually have two separate uplinks, which is quite nice.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 In previous camps, because it's difficult, we've only had one uplink.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And in the meantime, fiber has been built a lot more for ordinary users around the countryside.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So we've been able to get a connection here in the Ziegler Park and also one a little bit further away,

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 where we had to run a fiber through some fields manually to reach.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So you're actually taking the fiber cables and running them through fields, through trenches?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes, exactly. There's a lot of cables being installed around the site, which is actually more challenging.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Because there's a lot of things here at the Ziegler Park, a lot of train tracks and tents and so on, that are maybe in the way.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 This is also quite important in the planning stage. So a lot of work goes into planning before the event.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Where do we have to lay fiber? Because we need connectivity there.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And which routes can we use to get the connectivity there? Are there active train tracks?

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So we have to duck underneath or are there active road crossings and train tracks where we have to build a bridge over it?

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It's similar with the power team. So we cooperate together and have a look at each other's plans

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 and where we can do stuff a bit simpler and only do one bridge or only one trench under the train tracks.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But yeah, this is a lot of work before the event, because we cannot really dig here.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 There's a lot of old brickwork in the ground. So doing longer trenches is kind of impossible and really annoying.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So when does planning start for all of this?

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I think the first meeting usually is around GPM.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 That would be March, April, May in that area where we get together, meet who is there.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So it's not like we don't have to be there, but it's always kind of nice to meet friends and have a roughly idea on what we are doing.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And then most of the stuff is planned on the internet from home, doing kind of a lot of CAD works with a map, planning all the automation configuration.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Planning for this event is a bit easier because we already know the Ziegler Park having been here twice before already.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So we know what we're facing with train tracks and buildings and all this stuff. So that's a little bit easier.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And of course, things like there are some items which are a longer lead time, like arranging the actual uplink is really that work starts perhaps a year in advance, just to be sure.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So dear project office, please find a new location. Nock is looking for a new challenge.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Any rodent incidents so far? Because I think the last one or the one before we had a few outages.

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Yes, yes, no rodent incidents. We have had a train run over a fiber and we've had some other damage actually just accidental.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Well, I guess a rodent eating a fiber is also accidental, but yes, some other damage.

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And we have some more resilience this time as well because of improvements.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Yes, and also around the site as well. So we don't have to kind of rush to resolve problems immediately.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I mean, we already touched on it a little bit. So we have two uplinks to the campsite. What's the bandwidth?

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 We have a 20 gig plus a 10 gig. So we have 30 gigs available.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 A little bit smaller than at Congress.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Yes, yes, it is. Yes. But actually the usage is lower, right? It's a different kind of event in some ways.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And so, you know, our usage is I think like five gig or so around there. So that's perfectly fine.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So the usual credo use more bandwidth still applies.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Well, people can, yes, but actually most people should enjoy other things. There's plenty to see and do here.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Absolutely, absolutely. So once we have internet uplink into some sort of building in the data center, which we'll touch on in a minute.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 How do you distribute this around the campsite? You already touched on the topic of fiber. So you're laying fiber.

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Yes. So it's a lot easier for us because there's no real distance limitation to just run a lot of fiber.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So every Darden Klo really has a fiber uplink of some sort. So, yes, there's a lot of cables to run all around the site.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And that's what Nico was talking about with the planning and the work required there because we have to figure out how to run these cables.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And also a good thing with fiber is this electrical isolating. We have different generators on the sites powering different grids,

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 which are not necessarily on the same level. And we cannot connect these with copper cables.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 This is also why we require unshielded ethernet cables this year to be connected into the Darden Klo because we had incidents in 2019

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 where we had a coupling between two generators on a shielded ethernet cable. Luckily, no hacker was harmed there.

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But we still wanted to make sure that we can continue the tradition of not harming any hackers with power on network in this year's event.

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So the generators you mentioned, these are the braider nodes, the power generators to produce the electricity that all the hackers and tens and infrastructure needs.

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And so we have fiber all around the campsite. You're digging below. Usually you dig below the train lines. Some accidents happen.

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So you have fiber at several points at the campsite. And I've seen some people are not familiar with the Darden Klo.

79
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So the fiber ends in the Darden Klo at the switch probably. So could you explain a little bit what is the Darden Klo?

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Where does this come from? How does this work for people who have never heard of it?

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So actually what you need is you need to rent a large number of enclosures, right, that you can put your stuff in that are waterproof and easy to secure.

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And well, it turns out these plastic toilets, you can go to an event rental company and they can figure this out.

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So they're not equipped as actually with toilets. They don't have chemicals and there's not actually any toilet paper in there.

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They come right from the factory, right?

85
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Yeah, actually these did. Yes. And so, yes, but they're easy to rent and lock up.

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And so it's strange because people arrive and they think, oh, well, there's lots of toilets everywhere. Oh, camp next to the toilet.

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It will be convenient. It's like, yes, it is convenient, but for Wi-Fi and Internet.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So what's inside one of those plastic toilets?

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 At least a switch.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Some fiber?

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Yeah, some fiber connections, some power like for the local things and often things from from other teams as well.

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 We even have a picture left here.

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Yeah.

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So, yeah, you see some fiber spools on the ground.

95
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So usually our fiber comes on spools and we don't get new fiber for every event on the perfect length.

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So there will be usually more fiber left and these spools are in a dart and clove.

97
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And then there's a switch on the back. There's a POE injector for the Wi-Fi access point, which is also attached to the pole on the dart and clove on the outside.

98
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And we see a little black box on the right side with the yellow sticker on it, which is a CWDM splitter.

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We used this technique the first time last year at MCH in the Netherlands and reused that here too.

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And we got a little bit more.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 What's the benefit of using that? What's the functionality of this for someone who's not deep in technical?

102
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 This is difficult to explain without a diagram, actually.

103
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 However, we did a good presentation on this at the MCH event.

104
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 But yes, it really is. It's so we get some flexibility in how we run the fiber and the number of cores of the fiber we need.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Because, you know, we have like around 65 dart and clove.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So there's a lot of stuff we want to deploy this efficiently and not have quite so many fibers because that gets very difficult for us to manage.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 But the basic stuff is like with light. There are multiple colors of light and you can do the same thing on fiber.

108
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You can have different colored laser optics on the fiber and break in and out just a single color.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 So we have four decays in a row and each decay has a different color. So in the end, there's only one fiber cable with two cores in it, powering all four decays.

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And with this technique, we can also do redundancy a bit better because we can break it out from two sides.

111
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So most of the decays here this time have two times 10 gig uplink to two different sites on the venue here.

112
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And if one fiber breaks, there's a high chance that the dart and clove is still active on the remaining leg.

113
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 There are some dart and clove where this wasn't feasible in the planning stage.

114
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So they are single homes to one of our core sites, but it's still the best we could do.

115
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And those are the ones where the fiber has been damaged, of course.

116
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So just again for those viewers who have never been to such an event and are still confused.

117
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 The plastic toilet has a switch in it and people then come up with a regular cable and say, I want 10 gig of one gig connection to my tent.

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Do they just open the toilet or what's the process?

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So actually you unroll a cable and leave some slack for us to connect it.

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Well, actually our great NOC helped us volunteers. Our angels are going around with a big round.

121
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So they walk around the whole site and connect the cables over time.

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 So you leave your cable and they will come around, unlock, plug it in and move on to the next one.

123
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And then the same in reverse, I think, at the end of the event.

124
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And you mentioned earlier that this year the big change or one of the changes is that you're only allowing unshielded cables for the potential differential.

125
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Yeah. Well, what some people also do is they use a long shielded cable where the shield is only connected on one end

126
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and then have like a meter unshielded pigtail in the dart and claw to get rid of that problem,

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 but still have the benefit of a shielded cable on the long run, which is beneficial for 10 gig, which we do offer in these dart and claws here.

128
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 So you can get 10 gig to the tent, which I can't get at home, which is nice.

129
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Yes, actually nearly every port in those dart and claws is 10 gig capable now, 10 gig copper.

130
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 The support in people's laptops or so on is not so great, but it is available. Yes.

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And also it's the same band with up and down. So we don't do like one gig down and 100 meg up or 10 gig down and 10 meg up.

132
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 So no, you're doing the proper Internet. Yeah.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And if I connect my laptop to the cable, is that directly connected to the Internet or do I still have some firewall or some netting in between or?

134
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Only on the Wi-Fi. On the Wi-Fi we offer firewall connectivity because on the Internet there's a lot of port scanning going on

135
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and this is not good to have all these like probing packets on the Wi-Fi and also for the battery life of your smartphone.

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 If it gets constantly hammered with port scans, it will quite rapidly decrease.

137
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So the default on the Wi-Fi is to only allow connection from the camp site, but not from the Internet.

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But you can choose if you would like to accept that on your laptop or even on your phone.

139
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 But all the cabled connectivity is the bare Internet without any filtering, anything.

140
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So I should harden my laptop before I connect it to that cable.

141
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Or you should always harden your laptop before you connect to any cable.

142
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But especially here, it's different from at home. It's the raw stuff.

143
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You already mentioned Wi-Fi. I mean everything is wireless these days, of course.

144
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So you have an access point on every Datenclaw. How many?

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 So we have actually 146 live right now. What actually happens is you'll notice that's more than the number of Datenclaws we have deployed.

146
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And what we actually do is we start every Datenclaw has an AP. That's the thing on the pole that sticks out the top that people will see.

147
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And then we deploy like fill access points, like maybe in villages or in...

148
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 At heaven.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yeah, exactly. In the bigger tents and so on.

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And one of the things is we actually keep on building this during the event.

151
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's like people report poor coverage in an area and then we go, oh, hey, let's fix that.

152
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And then we keep on doing this until maybe halfway through the event. And then it becomes pointless.

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And you mentioned the access points are on top of the Datenclaw and then there is also a large lead tube, a colorful lead tube on top of that.

154
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 What is that about? I mean, a lot of people ask me, what is this thing doing on top of the Datenclaw?

155
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Apart from looking very nice, has it a functionality?

156
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Yes. Yeah. I think they've been with us since 2013.

157
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 They are basically receiving DMX or ArtNet data via Ethernet, showing the animation.

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So if the animation stops working, it will switch to a dim light.

159
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So you know that the Internet or the Ethernet is down in this Datenclaw.

160
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 If the power is down, obviously it will be dark.

161
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 But if the power is there, but only the network is down and has an issue, then it will be a dim light.

162
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 We are always kind of playing with the animation.

163
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So during the day we currently have a flame on. In the night it was a more dim or red or green flame.

164
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 In between we had some green with pink stars in it, kind of sparkling stars, which is a less visible or not less noticeable animation.

165
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 But it's kind of the color scheme of the camp, which is quite nice.

166
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So the animation can change, but as long as it's blinking, it's fine.

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So do you have one of your angels on top of the hill to watch out if all the Datenclaws are online, if all the lights are blinking?

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Or do you have a more sophisticated solution to monitor these things?

169
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Yeah, we have some monitoring.

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And one of the big changes we made this year was some implementing some things from other camps.

171
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 A lot of people would have looked at the map, the new map this year.

172
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And actually we have all the Datenclaw on the map and the icon changes color when the devices are deployed.

173
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 The Datenclaw is live, it goes green. If it then fails for whatever reason it goes red, which is pretty nice actually.

174
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Because often there's a local power outage or something like that. So we can report it and people can also know.

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Or a train running over your fiber.

176
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Exactly, yeah.

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Right. So that's how the Internet gets to the tents and to the Wi-Fi devices.

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 What about the services that we offer? We offer like Wikis and stuff like that.

179
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Is that all running through that 20 and 10 gig Internet connection?

180
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 We're very keen on the stuff that is necessary for the operation of the network. This actually processes sensitive personal data.

181
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Things like your MAC address, your IP address. And we like to collect as little data as possible and to not leave the site.

182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 So we have the servers that maybe say your DNS resolver and this kind of thing.

183
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And they're actually all wiped, securely wiped before they leave the site.

184
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So it's important for us that those services which are essential on the camp are hosted locally and we have a data center container for this.

185
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And then also we're hosting other servers for some other teams which are good to have on site.

186
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 For instance, like the DAFOC for video streaming and a few other teams as well.

187
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And do you also provide some sort of co-location? If people bring their own servers?

188
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Not here. It's too expensive because of the electricity source and the fact it's rather warm here.

189
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And we can really only provide this for like essential uses. And even then it's quite a bit of effort and cost to provide this.

190
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I think I've seen it's like one container with the blinking light.

191
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Yeah. So we started in 2019. We were like, why hide this away? Let's actually make it nice for people to look at.

192
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So now you can go and look in the window and peer in. And I can see from the fingerprints on the window quite a lot of people are looking in there.

193
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Maybe we should get a window cleaning agent.

194
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And of course it's locked up because otherwise people would improve the situation.

195
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Yes, and we need to keep the door shut because it needs to have air conditioning and so on.

196
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And also the other teams depend on their services being up and not being well fitted around with event phone is hosting in there.

197
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 The video streaming and recording is running in there. The GSM team has their rack in the colo.

198
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And that's basically it. It's us and the three others. So we only provide that service to a very close user group.

199
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 But since everyone can have 10 gig at their tent, it also lowers the need of a Yolo colo as we had on the congress earlier.

200
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 We even managed to get a second data center site this time so we can have a bit of redundancy.

201
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Most of the services are single home in the container.

202
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 But some of the stuff like the Wi-Fi controller, the uplink, the routing is also mirrored to a second site to minimize the outage if something breaks.

203
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The biggest enemy of network is always those big yellow heavy machines that either dig through the cables or unlock the container over.

204
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 So having some redundancy is always nice, right?

205
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 At least the big yellow machines having on site here are really friendly to our network.

206
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So we didn't have an incident with these. So they behave so far.

207
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Mostly it's actually people where we have power outages when it rains a lot and someone's left a connector in a puddle somewhere and then we cannot provide network without power.

208
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But we're working pretty closely with the power team here who are great. So we're making sure that it's all working.

209
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Well, I've heard of quite a few demands of delivering power over Wi-Fi. So if you could work on that, that would be awesome.

210
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Right. And of course, we have seen it at other events in the infrastructure review.

211
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 You also have a dashboard where you collect all the data and the traffic data and numbers galore.

212
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Yes, everyone loves these numbers and so on. I mean, we're at over 6000 Wi-Fi clients right now.

213
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And 89 switches deployed. So that's a good amount of hardware and a good number of users.

214
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 There's also good mobile coverage for people who do not want to use the network here now with Telco putting a mast here.

215
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But you're not controlling their mast, right? No, no. But it provides some alternatives.

216
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But most people need the network.

217
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Well, with our network, it's not much fun running around here with access to the map and everything.

218
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But increasingly, you know, all the other teams, they've discovered they can use computers to manage things and they need internet as well.

219
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I mean, even say the power team have a QR code you can scan to report issues.

220
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And there's lots of this ever more dependent on the network for so many other services that are provided for the camp.

221
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 For some reason, the video operating system, video operating center is still planning all these shows on the container walls.

222
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 We will have to convert them. Sometimes this way actually works.

223
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Most of our knock planning that's on site when we have small jobs and so on, we have a big Kanban board with Post-it notes.

224
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And it's very satisfying. You take a ticket, you move it from needs doing to in progress and you come back and you put it on there.

225
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It's done now. And now we have a whole wall of stickers that are done.

226
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Talking about done, we already touched on the topic of build up tear down.

227
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So that one thing is laying the cables, digging up trenches or whatever to lay the cables.

228
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 What about the software infrastructure? Is that is that also someone sitting and installing operating systems and stuff?

229
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Kind of. Yeah. Most of the stuff is reused between the events.

230
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So there's a big share of people in the Internet manufacturer also doing that on like the MCH last year in the Netherlands and likely again at the next Dutch camp.

231
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 In 2025 and also on EMF camp, there's a big share even Will has his nice T-shirt on.

232
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 So yeah, we try to reuse as much as possible of the stuff.

233
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So there's quite a lot of automation going on with event infra, which is located in the Netherlands and run by volunteers also from the NOC.

234
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So a lot of staging is going on there. Then more staging is going on here in an automated process.

235
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And we now even have it automated so far since at least 2019.

236
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And I think it started before that also port changes to have a port in a different VLANs are handled automatically.

237
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 So every switch is getting a new configuration every 15 minutes.

238
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So when the POC or the event phone people come around and ask for a new port for a deck station or if another OC needs something,

239
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 they have a guest or they have access to our Netbox where all the configuration is stored, can do the change and 50 minutes later it's deployed.

240
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Self-service really. That's what we need because it's too large to have another human in the loop.

241
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 So it's different to like the setup in the most of corporations where you need to fill in a SAP form and then run through 20 iterations and three months later you get the port opening.

242
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 No, there is no three months later.

243
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 We don't have a change advisory board every 14 days.

244
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 But also most of the teams are in a fairly similar constellation every event.

245
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So we know each other fairly well. They know how we roll. We know how they roll. So that's good for both sides.

246
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 So you're using the knowledge between the different events or friendly events or whatever you want to call them.

247
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And also I think the hardware and the network ranges, et cetera, that's also shared between the events because I noticed sometimes when I'm here, I'm still located in Amsterdam or near Amsterdam where the MCH was.

248
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Geolocation breaks with these kind of events.

249
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Yeah, mostly it's actually due to the access point because the access points move around and they go to a lot of events actually.

250
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And so you see that and sometimes it's due to the IP addressing as well.

251
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 But yes, yes, we do. We don't have a set of hardware and not use it. It's used by lots of other not for profit events around Europe.

252
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Yeah. Also Event Infra, which is lending out this equipment, is a non-profit in the Netherlands working with CCCV and all the other events.

253
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 So the events can borrow the hardware from Event Infra in return to a, I would say, competitive price.

254
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But it's really good for the event because it's from the community for the community.

255
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So some events, depending on what they do, donate more money. Other donate hardware, which is also fine.

256
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So there's an increasing big pool of switches, of Wi-Fi access points.

257
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 So I think most, if not even all of the stuff we use this time is coming from Event Infra.

258
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 So if some non-profit event needs some sort of network infrastructure, reach out and we will see and you will see what you can do.

259
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Yeah, there's a lot of teams, a lot of organizations using this.

260
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And you have to build the network yourself or find some people to do that. But it's not a full service operation.

261
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Hardware. If a for-profit wants to get rid of some hardware, which is still good to use,

262
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 so some data centers tend to kick out their old boxes after five years, which is not that long in our terms.

263
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 You can reach out to Event Infra to donate the hardware.

264
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 That's how we were able to offer 10 gig copper to all the areas because an organization was clearing out the data center.

265
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And we said, thank you very much and took 60 odd switches.

266
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And otherwise they would probably have to pay to get them disposed properly.

267
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Yeah.

268
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 OK, I think we touched on most of the points in an event like EMF Camp or MCH or the next Dutch Camp or CCC Camp.

269
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Is your team filled up? Are you still looking for volunteers during build-up or tear down?

270
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Or is it too fragile? Do you need so much inside info that it doesn't make sense to offer you help?

271
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Always during tear down. Every team wants help during tear down.

272
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And because there's just so much infrastructure that we need to roll up and put away.

273
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But we do have a quite well organized system for this because we know we have databases and things with all the bits of equipment in.

274
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 So it's not just randomly done, but people can come and help us.

275
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Please don't go to the Daten Klo and just tear down.

276
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Exactly.

277
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And at that point, come to the NOC and ask what tasks you could do.

278
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Yeah, we have checklists to collect all the items and make sure and then we know and everything is also wiped before it's both in terms of its storage and its physical surface, which can get quite dusty before it's packaged and sent back.

279
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Since most of our work is before and long before the event, there are always some friendly people who approach us on like day minus one or day zero and want to help us.

280
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But this time the network was finished building up everything on day minus one.

281
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 So we had to send them away because there was no work to do on these days.

282
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 But on early build-up or then the tear down, there's always more help to do.

283
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And we always had a lot of angels again this time to help out during the setup.

284
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 So we built teams with, I would say, one experienced member of the NOC and one or two more angels.

285
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And this worked really well.

286
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Yes, it has to be.

287
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You have to have some experience with plugging in fibers and so on.

288
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And all this work is physical during build-up.

289
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 We're not like sitting at our desks like configuring things because we have a computer for that.

290
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 It's running around the field, it's driving around the field.

291
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 It's a lot of manual work than you would like to think.

292
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 But many of us have desk jobs and so it's great fun to come in the field and do that.

293
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And after the first tape, the whole body complains.

294
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 That's what ibuprofen is for.

295
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Many of us are also working in the industries and the colleagues are always asking why are you on vacation and why are you doing basically the same thing.

296
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 But it's not really the same thing.

297
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And it's with different people.

298
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 So all of us are doing that because we really want to do that.

299
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And this is a whole other team experience than getting paid to do that.

300
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You learn a lot in both technical and transferable skills by coming and volunteering for many of the teams here.

301
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Absolutely. I can totally attest to that.

302
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I have one last question.

303
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 We didn't touch on this when we talked about the datum clothes.

304
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I have to circle back a little bit.

305
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 As you said in your explanation, these are plastic toilets.

306
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 They look like plastic toilets.

307
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 The print on them says it's a toilet.

308
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Do people use them as toilets?

309
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Unfortunately, what happens is a big pile arrive in a field and maybe we don't get there to log them early enough.

310
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And someone maybe also really needs to go.

311
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 So they have an accident.

312
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 So unfortunately, every time there's always one that's quarantined off and left for proper disposal.

313
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Yes, exactly.

314
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 This time the number was fairly low.

315
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 We calculated five spare datum clothes and only needed two of them.

316
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 So that's good.

317
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And hopefully shows like this will get out the word so maybe we can get the number down.

318
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Accidents happen.

319
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 The major thing for ordinary users out there to know about most of our infrastructure is that we can't know it's broken sometimes unless you tell us.

320
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 But we will come and fix it if there's a problem.

321
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Any last words from you on NOC?

322
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Did we miss something?

323
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Any important topics you want to get out?

324
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Messages?

325
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 There's a few things that people, if they want to know more, they can go and look in the entrance of the DC, the data center, which is near the info desk.

326
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 There's quite a lot of information online.

327
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 We're now FAQ as well if you're still having some trouble.

328
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And the NOC help desk will also help you with the service.

329
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Is there unshielded cable at the NOC help desk?

330
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I got that question quite often.

331
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 I think the Spatii is selling Ethernet cables.

332
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Ah, OK.

333
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 They have some cable, maybe even some cable left.

334
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 I'm not sure.

335
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 But they had some.

336
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 We do ask people to bring their own cables because we can't provide for 6,000 users.

337
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 But who reads documentation before the event, right?

338
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yeah, well, we do write it.

339
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 I'm not blaming you.

340
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 I'm just asking.

341
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Anything else we didn't touch on?

342
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Anything else you want to touch on?

343
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 No, I think that's most of it.

344
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 We could go on for hours.

345
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I'm not going into technical details or tech porn.

346
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 A lot of the stuff when we want to explain it is like you need a diagram and some actual slides and things like that.

347
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And that's more in-depth.

348
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And to be honest, we've covered that a lot in previous review presentations and things like that, which are all on media.ccc.de.

349
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And you're doing an infrastructure review as well for this event, right?

350
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Oh, we better write that then.

351
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 We should start preparing one.

352
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Some funny photos.

353
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 This one is going to be quite short, like 3 to 5 minutes.

354
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Probably just some funny photos.

355
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Most of the stuff is still valid from MCH's review, so we could just share the link.

356
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Yes, adjust the data.

357
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 All right.

358
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Well, thank you very much, Will H.

359
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Nico Tuck, thanks for joining us in the studio.

360
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Thanks for having us.

361
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 This was another episode of Ask the Teams, this time with the Network Operating Center.

362
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Have a great day and hopefully see you really soon in another episode.

363
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Cheers and bye bye.

364
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
