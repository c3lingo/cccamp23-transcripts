00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:37.520
 Hi, we are here to talk about that in our hacker space in Copenhagen,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.240
 we have a fiber connection and have a BDP setup and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.960
 have a rack that looks like this next to our fridge with all our matter.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.200
 And if we go a little bit closer,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.280
 you can see that we have a lot of small single board computers.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 And that's because that we have a lot of small bit devices.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.840
 But to go a little bit back, we have since 2017,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.600
 had a fiber connection and had a BDP setup with a public ASN.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 And we got a 24 sponsored by a friendly organization.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.840
 So it's quite nice.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.760
 And then we started doing members machines a little bit later.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.400
 So that members can have some more experience playing with network and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.080
 BDP and routing and trying to have a machine on the Internet.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.120
 And VPS is also available and stuff like that, but

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.600
 it's a bit more fun to have physical hardware.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 So yeah, low power devices and just best effort service,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.000
 no service level agreement.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.160
 We have dual stack, so both IPv6 and IPv4.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.280
 And we have the ability to write your own IP addresses as well.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.960
 So we have some members that have their own mostly IPv6 space and their own ASNs.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.880
 And we are currently around 15 machines on this setup.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.280
 But we expect it to be growing a bit soon.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 But yeah, it's still small scale, but it's a fun, small,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.400
 HackerSpace project.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.680
 So in order for us to cover some of the costs associated with it,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.560
 like power wise, we have small monthly fee on it.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.640
 But the main thing is just that we want people to also be full member of Laptap and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.600
 have access to the HackerSpace and so on, so

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.680
 that they can service machines themselves and so on.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 But yeah, then Oliver wants to talk a bit about managing all these machines physically.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.720
 >> Yes, just a word of clarification.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.320
 This is not only for BGP playing, it is also just for micro hosting of any kind.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.680
 So it might sound like it might need quite a bit of experience.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.640
 That's not the case.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 You could just start with a pie and host your own services or a website or

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 whatever that is.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.520
 So I want to talk a bit about the takeaways from five years of Labicolo.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.520
 The first one is the big one.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.760
 The thing about computers are not made to live in large communities.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.440
 They are not made for scalability.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.520
 They have cables sticking out in all four directions,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.760
 sometimes a fifth if there's a header on it.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 They, We all know how that looks.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.800
 They, these power strips out there have many different kinds of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.520
 small power supplies that can overheat and that can just fall out.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.280
 All these things are quite challenging if it's in the same rack that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.480
 you also need for infrastructure and where you want reliability.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.920
 So the main takeaway is it needs to be managed.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.640
 And these are, this is a work in progress.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.320
 If you want it to be accessible for many members, you need to,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 with very little complication, be able to add more devices pretty much spontaneously.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.240
 And that only goes if that's, if it's not a huge spaghetti mess of loose cables,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.120
 which the pictures don't show.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.600
 That is right after tidying up.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.400
 It is, believe me, it's super neat.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.280
 So what our idea is for the future is to make a kind of a campsite kind of setup

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.880
 where you come in from the back and each shelf has a little maybe ten port switch.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.080
 And then we can get away with very short cables.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.720
 So to keep it manageable.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.600
 The main goal is to get more members on board that have a tiny machine and

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600
 get to play with it.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.680
 So more machines is the entire idea.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 More people that have more experience with small things on the internet.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.800
 And more ASNs.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.920
 >> Yeah, so if we look on BDP, then we are tied for

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.360
 the seventh largest neutral facility in Denmark.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.120
 So we hope to get up to the top four soon.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.640
 And then the last thing is just that we have,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.280
 there's another talk about our internet exchange on day three.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.480
 And we have a meet up on day three after that as well to talk more about

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.440
 the BDP experiences and hack experiences.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.440
 >> Thank you.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440
 >> [APPLAUSE]
