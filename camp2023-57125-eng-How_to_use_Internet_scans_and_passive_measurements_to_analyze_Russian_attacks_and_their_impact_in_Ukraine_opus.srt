3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,120
 So, please welcome Johannes Klöck with how to use internet scans and

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,480
 passive measurements to analyze Russian attacks and their impact in Ukraine.

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,920
 >> [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,320
 >> Hello, welcome.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,400
 My name is Johannes Klöck.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm here for talking to you about how to use internet scans and

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
 passive measurements to analyze Russian attacks and the impact in Ukraine.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,280
 I'm Sion Kofon of IFAS Strike Labs,

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,520
 it's a company about which is does scanning whole the day, the internet.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 And then we do also a lot of research,

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,800
 have also published last CAHOS communication camp.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
 I have published here a talk how to set up a search engine and

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
 which ways you can globally scan the internet several times.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,600
 And now we use much more of this data for making advanced research.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,240
 So, but before we start with the Russian attacks and

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,680
 how we can measure the impact using global internet scans.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,960
 I'm here more also to talk about why the resilience of the Ukraine in terms of

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,360
 internet is so high.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,200
 So maybe, so at first it's really sad that the power of the beamer is not that high.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
 I hope you can see something.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,240
 Interesting point is that when we talk about Ukraine,

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,600
 we can see that approximate 55% of all end users in Ukraine

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
 are served by very small ISPs.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,560
 So we can see this there in a circle.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,640
 We can see that like 45% are served by larger ISPs,

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,240
 which serve more than 1% of the whole end clients.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 But 55% of all end clients in Ukraine are served by an ISP that

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,560
 is managing less than 1% of the whole clients in Ukraine.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
 When you compare it to Germany, on the next slide,

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,160
 we can see that in Germany in comparison to that only 18%

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,760
 of end users are managed by very small ISPs, less than 1%.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,240
 So we can see that in Ukraine we have much more diversity in terms of small ISPs.

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,320
 They are each connected to each other.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,440
 And when one ISP has maybe no power or maybe fails out,

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,200
 the traffic can go route through another ISP.

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,560
 And this makes it much more resilient.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,920
 Here in Germany we have approximate one third of all end clients

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,320
 on Deutsche Telekom.

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,080
 The other third is on Vodafone.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
 This means at least when one of these ISPs get knocked out by somehow a strike,

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
 we will have big troubles here in Germany.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
 And we are not thinking-- the next point is also the day kicks, right?

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
 That's also a point.

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,560
 But in Ukraine, they have a huge amount of very small ISPs serving approximate half

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,800
 of the whole end clients we have there.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,960
 And this makes the internet itself in Ukraine very robust

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,360
 compared to Western countries.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
 Before I explain about the results we have,

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,200
 I just want to tell something about how we collected the data.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,400
 So what we are, we have our own internet service provider.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,680
 We have our two different slash 22s.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,560
 This means over 2,000 different IP addresses which we use for internet scanning.

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
 This means we are scanning the internet.

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,280
 And each time when we connect to a new system, we use a new IP address.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
 And this leads to the fact that we like half an hour,

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,320
 we visit with the same address, the same network.

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,680
 So each 30 minutes.

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,760
 This gives us a very good opportunity to be another radar of a lot of intrusion detection systems

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,880
 and prevents a lot of blocking.

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,680
 Our staff has been developed in a free university of Berlin

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
 financed by the Federal Ministry of Education Research and Former Times.

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,120
 This was around '14 to '15, '17.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,920
 Then we found out of that a company and did some cool interesting stuff.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,120
 And now we are coming to the point that when we are doing all the time the internet scans

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,920
 and see, okay, where are the clients we have seen, especially in Ukraine,

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,600
 when the war started, that a lot of clients availability dropped.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,080
 And they said, okay, that's very interesting.

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,200
 We need to investigate it because it makes sense when maybe a lot of power outage we have.

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,680
 And we know that the Russians have attacked a lot of critical infrastructure

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
 in the Ukraine.

73
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,160
 Then where there's no power, there's also a high chance that you have no internet

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
 because also routers and so on need a lot of power, right?

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,240
 And especially in the end, in the small office, home office from the people,

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,040
 where there's not so small routers, no power, there will be also no internet.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,040
 That is why we have taken as base reference for our analyzers October 21,

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,280
 which is approximately half a year before the Russians started their attacks,

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,640
 as the reference said, okay, these amount of servers we have seen is the 100%,

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,400
 the baseline.

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,000
 And then we have seen how are the services behaving when the Russians started their attack.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
 And here we see the first chart.

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,000
 I hope you can see it somehow.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,080
 On the left, we have started by 100% for different protocols for HTTPS, SSH,

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,680
 HTTP host, DNS host, SMTP hosts.

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,440
 And we can see in the middle of the chart that there is approximately the end of February,

87
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,400
 beginning of March 22, where the red arrow is somehow seeable.

88
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,120
 We can see there's a huge drop in service availability.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,160
 This is here, for instance, this is a special area of Ukraine.

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
 This is in the northeast Ukraine.

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,040
 This is northeast also from Kiev.

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,920
 This is the region where when we have here, Charnivy, this is the oblast of Kiev,

93
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:13,760
 got invaded by Belarus and by Russia and got occupied by approximately 70%.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,600
 And we can see that during the occupation, a lot of services in that area went down,

95
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,720
 especially the web services and also the mail services.

96
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,960
 But one service still was very steady.

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,920
 This was DNS.

98
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,640
 And this was some of the thought, okay, that's very interesting.

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,360
 We can see a lot of services dropped by approximately 60%, but only DNS is quite still stable.

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,760
 When we compare now, especially the results from the beginning of March with the end of

101
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,880
 the beginning of April, we can see that in the beginning of April, remember, the Russians

102
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
 had a lot of logistic problems.

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,920
 They needed to retreat going back to Belarus, et cetera, and then they released Kiev, right?

104
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,360
 And then we can see the services are going up again.

105
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,800
 So some people said that, oh, maybe they have just fixed the infrastructure and then the

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
 services go up, right?

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,600
 But we see that all the time DNS is very steady.

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,760
 We have talked to some companies that have third-party providers based in Ukraine, and

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,200
 they told us that before the Russians have invaded them, they have shut down their system

110
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,640
 for data integrity protection and also data theft protection, right?

111
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,960
 And that's why they have brought down their servers, but DNS was still active because

112
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,240
 if you have ever tried to boot up a whole AD Windows infrastructure without DNS, it's

113
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
 not possible, right?

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,480
 That is the last core services you will remain, and that is why we see that we have seen DNS

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,660
 was quite steady and all other services went down by 60%, and after the Russians retreated

116
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,160
 and went back to their country, to Belarus, it went up again, right?

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
 This was very interesting.

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,360
 We have seen this kind of behavior and seen, okay, we need to now make more intense scans

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,960
 on an hourly basis to understand and to see maybe we can also see where some Russian rockets

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,000
 attack some power plants and if we can maybe see in that region, we can see that a lot

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,760
 of servers are also going down and going up after some other hours when the power is up

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 again.

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,200
 And I will show that.

124
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,920
 Here we can see also a very special case that is a Mario pole.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,120
 You can maybe see we have also set 100% for all protocols, and then for all protocols,

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,760
 it goes down by 90%, right?

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,040
 Mario pole is a city that's very close to the cities that were attacked very hard, very

128
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,800
 first by a lot of critical airstrikes and so on.

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,680
 On the right side, you could normally see data from the European Space Administration.

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,440
 They have done some radar scans and have seen that approximately 90% of all buildings are

131
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,080
 now like 10 up to 50 meters lower than before because they got completely destroyed, right?

132
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,360
 And using our internet scans, we can also see that approximately 90% of all network

133
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,480
 services we have identified in that region are also not existing anymore since the beginning

134
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,920
 of the invasions and the attacks of the Russians.

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,440
 This means we could also just sitting here in Berlin scanning from our IP addresses,

136
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,680
 we can just use it like a radar looking if you're up, are you up, are you up?

137
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
 Oh no, you're down.

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,720
 And then we can see that 90% of all service in Mario pole went down like in the first

139
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,200
 two weeks of the attacks by the Russians and 90% are not still available anymore.

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,880
 And this shows us that also for a long time, for at least three months, this shows us that

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,240
 you can use internet scans for use some kind of battle damage assessment to see how big

142
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,600
 is the attack and how big is the result of the attack also for the region.

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,440
 This information is for instance important for when you are the Ministry for Foreign

144
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,000
 Affairs and you support some NGOs, for instance, right?

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,400
 Then it would be very interesting to see how big is the grade of destructions in a certain

146
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
 area.

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,240
 And you can use this kind of information for rough estimation.

148
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,960
 So what we then did is that we said, okay, we have selected 400,000 static IP addresses

149
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,040
 in Ukraine.

150
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,920
 It's like having vantage points for measuring.

151
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,640
 And then we have scanned these 400,000 static IP addresses every four hours just for looking

152
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,760
 where in the region services are going up or going down.

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,680
 Very important, static is very important because if you use dynamic IP addresses, dynamic IP

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,120
 addresses are very often up or down because people switch off their mobile router or get

155
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,760
 a new IP address, whatever.

156
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
 That is why we have chosen static IP addresses.

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,800
 And as you can remember, we know that especially in October 2022, this was the first big attack

158
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,600
 of the Russians against the critical infrastructure of the Ukraine.

159
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,360
 A lot of reports also from Reuters has shown this was the first well-known Russian attack

160
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,320
 against the critical infrastructure.

161
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,680
 And then we have chosen open source intelligence.

162
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,280
 Here on the right side, you can see somehow a map from Wikipedia, which has collected

163
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,680
 tons of reports from social media and also from newspapers where in a certain region

164
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,600
 Russian have attacked and where we have received a power outage in that region.

165
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,480
 And the interesting point is that in all regions where we have seen that the open source intelligence

166
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,920
 says, or here the social media says there was a power outage, we can also see that we

167
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
 have a drop in our scans.

168
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,400
 So for instance, here we can see on the map on Chenevy, which is in the northeast, this

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:51,000
 is a country that which got not, this is an uplast like a state of the Ukraine, which

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,520
 got not directly hit, also received not a power outage, but all surrounding states or

171
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,320
 uplasts of Chenevy have received power outages.

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,220
 And we can also see this in the data.

173
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,080
 On the right side, when you can see a small drop, this is a drop we can see on the power

174
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,240
 outages in Chenevy because all the border regions also received a power loss.

175
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,000
 And for making, showing you that also the opposite also works very well, we can see

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 that in Odessa, which is in the southwest of Ukraine, we can see there was no power outage

177
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,080
 given by the social media and in other newspapers.

178
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,560
 And there we can see the data acquired steady, steady, steady line on the availability of

179
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,480
 the network services.

180
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,000
 Now we are going directly to Sumi, which is an uplast, which received a bigger power outage

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,400
 and there we can see here on the right side, a big drop by approximately 90 up to 80% across

182
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,120
 all protocols.

183
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,200
 When we remember we have seen the Chenevy first stuff we have seen there was still DNS

184
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,680
 was still running. In that case, we can see that HTTP, SSH, HTTPS and DNS, all services

185
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,840
 went down exactly at the moment as the social media also reports there has been Russian

186
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,800
 attacks in the security infrastructure and also says there was a power outage.

187
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,400
 And we can just say, okay, yes, we can also measure that.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,560
 This is also, we can also estimate here, we can see the power drop and we can just estimate

189
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,640
 that the power outage was around 12 hours.

190
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:35,000
 So we say when approximately 80% of all services up again, we say the power outage is over.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,800
 We can see after 12 hours 80% are reached and then they took three further days to get

192
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,920
 up to 100%.

193
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
 That is very interesting.

194
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,600
 Also when you are an NGO it is very interesting to understand how many fuel I need to take

195
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 or how to cover these power outage time for instance or how to maybe what kind of turbines

196
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,760
 do energy turbines do as you create need.

197
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,560
 And so this is very interesting data because you can just on a social media you can just

198
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,440
 see there was some kind of power outage but you can't half measure how long it is.

199
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
 And here we have very good qualified data for doing that.

200
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,440
 So this data here was for Sumi.

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
 We can also see this for Poltava.

202
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,840
 Poltava is the same.

203
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 We can see here on the right side a drop across all protocols and also here in this time this

204
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,800
 was eight hours but it was not that big.

205
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
 It was approximately only by 40% drop.

206
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,960
 We can also see this here for Ternopil.

207
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,520
 There was a first strike on the night from the 6th to the 7th October and also on the

208
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,200
 10th October we can see also a bigger drop.

209
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,040
 And then what's very interesting you can see here they have been fighting really really long

210
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,960
 for getting up to the 100% because at first they just went to the 80% and then you get

211
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,520
 up and they get down and so on.

212
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:05,600
 You can see that the energy grid was very unstable for at least three up to four days.

213
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:14,160
 So here we have just a table which shows us where power outage has been detected by the

214
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,800
 open source and social media and what our results are showing.

215
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,520
 We can see that very often when we have power outage detected we also have our mechanisms

216
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,520
 detected in it or our algorithm.

217
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,480
 And we did a Pearson correlation coefficient analyzer and we got a strong correlation because

218
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,000
 we got a result from 0.74 which indicates a strong correlation using our methodology

219
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
 for detecting power outages in Ukraine.

220
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,240
 It has a strong correlation to the open source and social media reports.

221
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,160
 So this means that the algorithm and the technology is working and it's very interesting.

222
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,640
 So now we can see the next like approximately half a year later on the 9th of March the

223
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,000
 Russians attacked again the critical infrastructure of the Ukraine.

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,480
 And the very interesting point is that we measured it again and this time we can see

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:20,840
 for instance here for Dnipropetrovsk Oblast there was only a small power outage like 20%

226
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 for eight hours.

227
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:28,480
 We can also see this here for Kivororod which was also a very small power outage like 40%

228
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
 only for eight hours.

229
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:36,320
 So when we now go further and investigate it we understand we have seen here that on

230
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,920
 the October the power outage was every time like 80% for 12 up to 15 hours.

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,840
 And then it took like three days they recovered completely to 100%.

232
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,800
 But half a year later the Russian attacks are not so have not such big impact because

233
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,400
 here we can see power outages now only maximum 80% very close to the 100% 100% and then it's

234
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 easier.

235
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,040
 I talked to some Ukraine guys and they said yes because we learned to deal with that.

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,960
 A lot of Ukrainian civilian people have now small energy turbines, generators and so on

237
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,760
 and they self power them for the time of the outage.

238
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:25,440
 We have also the United States have provided big very big power generators, huge turbines

239
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:32,040
 like big cars that are able to distribute power for the whole district of a city.

240
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,840
 So they distributed the power supply of the Ukraine using mobile generators, the civilians

241
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,640
 on their own and also by the government supported by the Germans and the United States.

242
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,120
 And we can see in our measurements that the impact of the power outages are much lower

243
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,640
 than before because we can see it's not over the 50% before we had like 80-90% now it's

244
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,480
 maximum 50% and also the time of the power outages has decreased by 50% because we now

245
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,080
 have only like eight hours up to the 100%.

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,120
 It's very interesting to see that the Russian attacks against the power grid is less efficient

247
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,240
 than before in October and that is measurable by internet scans.

248
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,600
 This is so fascinating right that you can sit here and see the data and analyze it from

249
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,320
 home not being there but you can make very interesting research about these kind of topics.

250
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,960
 Okay now we are also looking for the Russian control right so we have here Zaborozhina

251
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,440
 which is under Russian control and we can see that the power attacks against the Zaborozhina

252
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,440
 against the Russian controlled area has no impact.

253
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,800
 So we can see that the Russians are not attacking their own region right they are not impacted

254
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,400
 by their own attacks because there's also cross-check you have to do right maybe there's

255
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 some general failure in my methodology but this is very interesting to see that the Russians

256
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,760
 are all the time steady in their controlled area and that they attack only the Ukraine

257
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,880
 power grid system and they do not impact themselves.

258
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,960
 Okay this was about kinetic strike detection and to understand how you can use internet

259
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,240
 scans for detection and to analyze it.

260
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,320
 Now we are going to more presumably Russian attacks so very interesting is we have Kherson.

261
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:21,080
 Kherson is a city which was very heavily contested and which went under control in the end of

262
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,000
 March and April under the Russians and what we can see here is the BGP dependency graph

263
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,640
 this means we can see here from Kherson Telecom which is an ISP an internet service provider

264
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:41,120
 of Kherson we can see where do they give or who is the main upstream provider of Kherson

265
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,840
 Telecom right so this means when you serve on your network where is the traffic for Kherson

266
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
 Telecom clients going through.

267
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,700
 And here we can see it was taken by Ucomline, Ucomline was the upstream provider of Kherson

268
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,000
 Telecom and in the beginning of May in the first May we can see there is a switch.

269
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,720
 The switch there is a switch that say have give 100 percent of the traffic to Ucomline

270
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,320
 which is Ukraine ISP and then there was a switch to Miranda AS Miranda Autonomous System

271
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,040
 so who is Miranda?

272
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,120
 Just looking Miranda Media Limited is the ISP is the new upstream provider of Kherson

273
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,320
 Telecom in the first of May there was a change on the BGP data very interesting first of

274
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,560
 May is also a holiday in Ukraine right day of labor and we can see Miranda Limited is

275
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:37,320
 ISP which is has been founded in 2014 on the Crimea interesting right and when we see also

276
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,160
 on the right data they states it's in Crimea and belongs to the Russian Federation so we

277
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,920
 see it looks like a Russian ISP doing some more investigation we can see here that also

278
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:59,320
 Miranda Limited is responsible for the internet C cable that connected Crimea and Russia mainland

279
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:07,040
 right and very interesting point is that these internet cable was finished in 2014 very close

280
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:16,760
 to the invasion to Crimea and these internet cable was also provided by a Chinese cable

281
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,840
 layer called Ying Gong Wan right isn't fascinating to understand these political behaviors behind

282
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,560
 that so we have here clearly an Russian ISP and ISP that is also operating a C cable connecting

283
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,760
 Crimea and Russian mainland and so it makes totally sense that they are the new upstream

284
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,160
 provider of Kherson Telecom a city they have invaded and very interesting is that you can

285
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,920
 see later as there was on the 4th of May we can see there is somehow back switch to data

286
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,560
 group as of going back to Ukraine ISP and then there is also New York Times report which

287
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:03,320
 says yes very important a lot of different reports especially in Kherson Russian people

288
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,800
 arrived Russian soldiers arrived and tried to get control about the internet infrastructure

289
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,760
 and also telecommunication companies so this time here in the first time of war we can

290
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,960
 really see that the internet as part of critical infrastructure is also a tactical objective

291
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,960
 obviously right so Russians came and say please switch off your routes going to Miranda ISP

292
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,520
 that's how it's working and interesting point is that we can see so here we can see that

293
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,760
 on the 4th of May there was switch back to the Ukraine ISP and it looks like then they

294
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,120
 used maybe more forces or so that different there's a huge topic on the Facebook channel

295
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,920
 of Kherson Telecom where the CEO says yes there was no connection I was not forced by

296
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,320
 the Russians but I thought it's better to use the Russian internet than the Ukrainian

297
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,960
 because it's more stable and so on and so on right so but it's very hard to say here

298
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,720
 from Germany what's the retry but we can see that in the end of May 31 May we can see since

299
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,920
 November 2022 it was all the time Miranda as was the primary upstream provider of Kherson

300
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:20,400
 Telecom and then we can remember that in 9 November the Russians retreated from Kherson

301
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,280
 they went back and the interesting is we can also see this in the BGP data because exactly

302
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,760
 to the 9th November Kherson Telecom has no upstream provider anymore the Russians have

303
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
 cut the lines and then they moved away from Kherson right and this is also seeable by

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,360
 the BGP data very interesting is Kherson Telecom went never up again they are now completely

305
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,440
 away and I have heard some rumors that the CEO of Kherson Telecom went also in prison

306
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,200
 or gets accused but there's still some some social media stuff right it's very hard to

307
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,560
 prove the truth we can just see here the data on the BGP and we can see that the Russians

308
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,160
 have somehow tried to get control about the upstream of Kherson Telecom in the end of May

309
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,080
 they have received the control all traffic went through Kherson Telecom it's very important

310
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,720
 because for censorship of course you can also identify maybe partisan troops try to communicate

311
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,880
 using the internet whatever and then when they retreated from Kherson the lines got cut

312
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,240
 and we can see no connection anymore for Kherson Telecom so this was the second part now we

313
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:32,040
 are coming to the third part of the talk we also operate a third /22 just as a black sensor

314
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,920
 network it's an under name from a different company and the black sensor network we call

315
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,360
 internally the cyber echelon right this means it's just collecting the data just when you

316
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,960
 make some ping probe some TCP-SYN traffic whatever it's just it's a sinkhole it's just recording

317
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,400
 all the data and enriches the data who is connecting what is the what is the autonomous

318
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,880
 system from the IP addresses that get sent from and so on but you will never receive

319
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,000
 an answer from this black hole network using this we can also understand how are people

320
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,520
 scanning and if maybe there's a new RDP vulnerability for instance we can use this kind of technology

321
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,120
 to see who is scanning for new RDP ports or for new vulnerabilities and so on that is

322
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,720
 for why we have these sensor network but the interesting point is that we have approximately

323
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:31,360
 160 million packets per day and the over 90 percent of all the data is TCP data we receive

324
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,480
 5% UDP data 3% ICMP pings so and the interesting point here is that we can see here on the

325
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,320
 left or you can see nothing but I will now explain the chart okay so imagine it's like

326
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,640
 that and then we have time of war and then immediate increase of the TCP packets we receive

327
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,000
 from the Ukraine so suddenly this war begins and we receive a lot of traffic from the Ukraine

328
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,280
 on our sensor network and that's very interesting we thought why so when we try to understand

329
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,720
 TCP handshake normally you send a SYN you get a SYN ACK back then you send an ACK connection

330
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,120
 established layer 4 communication very easily and then we have looked what kind of packets

331
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,000
 do we receive and then we have seen we receive SYN ACK packets so this means we receive packets

332
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,840
 from server they say yes we it's okay that you tries to connect to me I want to set up

333
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,120
 a connection also to you right makes no sense because we have a black hole sensor network

334
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,200
 we have never sent some kind of connection request so why do we receive SYN ACK communication

335
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,080
 and then we have thought about it okay makes sense somebody is spoofing randomly IP addresses

336
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,080
 sending it out against Ukraine targets and then Ukraine targets are responding with SYN

337
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,600
 ACK packets back to our sensor network because when you randomly spoof IP addresses you will

338
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,240
 also randomly spoof some IP addresses of our black hole sensor networks we have 1000 IP

339
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,760
 addresses there will be some when you send tons of packets there's a very good chance

340
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,320
 that you will also spoof some of our IP addresses so just it's illustrated the attacker is sending

341
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,200
 spoofed SYN packets to the Ukraine victim and the victim is replying with SYN ACK packets

342
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,320
 and some of the SYN ACK packets are also hitting our sensor network and in that way we can

343
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:31,320
 identify who is the victim of the DDoS attack right so we can see we can see that especially

344
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,600
 in the beginning of April so on a chart you can't see here but you have to imagine now

345
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,680
 we can see that in the beginning of April the first April there's a high spike up to the

346
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,440
 end of May and then there's anything anymore right so somebody has somehow fired a DDoS

347
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,600
 attack against Ukraine server and in that case we have looking who is the IP address

348
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 that's sending us the SYN ACK packet it was President Gov UA right so somebody DDoSed

349
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,000
 President Gov UA by randomly spoofing IP addresses and it's very easy to do that and it's also

350
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,760
 hard to fight against this kind of traffic and you just rent some bulletproof holster

351
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,640
 which allows SYN TCP IP spoofing and then you can I don't know for 500 euros you can

352
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,640
 also get 10 gigabit connection and then you try to fire against it the problem is against

353
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,520
 this kind of traffic is it's very hard it's not that you receive DDoS traffic from a certain

354
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,600
 autonomous system and then it's very hard to block because you receive completely different

355
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,400
 packets from a lot of different ISPs because they randomly spoof the IP addresses but the

356
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,160
 other point on these kind of attackers you have to buy a lot of bandwidth but normally

357
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,280
 there was also another talk today two hours before very often DDoS attacks are also executed

358
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,540
 that you try to identify a multiplier like DNS or NTP server you send traffic and they

359
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:05,240
 send a 10 or 20 times amount back to the victim in that case here we have people that are

360
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,080
 spoofing IP addresses and sending it directly to the victim and the victim is replying somehow

361
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,880
 to us because they also spoofed our IP addresses and we can see that the exact in the beginning

362
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,600
 of April the first April is it they started the attack and the end of April they finished

363
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,220
 and then we can also see that in the beginning of May they started the attack winding up

364
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,920
 going down the end of May and then exact and the beginning on June they are starting the

365
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,720
 attack and the end of June they stopped so we can really see a very good pattern on these

366
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,560
 kind of Russian attacks it's so it's in the beginning of the month it looks like somebody

367
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,160
 has paid maybe somebody for doing something and then starting on the first of May yes

368
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,080
 sir we are starting on the first of May you know so it makes no sense that you really

369
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,420
 start it's begin exactly the beginning of the month you DDoS attacks so that's a freelancer

370
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,880
 the hacker would never work like that right so starting exactly on the first of the month

371
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,440
 yeah very interesting to see that so the second attack we have investigated here on the beginning

372
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,440
 of June and the beginning of July was booking Gov. UA this is a portal where you can book

373
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
 your train stuff where you can get your tickets where you can travel around Ukraine which

374
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,120
 is also important for truth movements because also the Russian soldiers move by train of

375
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,960
 course when they go home for some stuff and so on and so we can also see they have attacked

376
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,440
 the presidential website and also the critical infrastructure the train systems the booking

377
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:41,600
 system okay so also so now putting stuff in a nutshell we can use internet scans combined

378
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,200
 with open source intelligence data and also a satellite imagery we remember on the European

379
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,320
 space administration picture of Mario Pol and we can also to make strong correlations

380
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,400
 for various events in the Ukraine in the in the Ukraine Russian conflict we can use very

381
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,800
 intense internet scans like we have done in the scanning Ukraine's aesthetic server every

382
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,440
 four hours to measure the impact of kinetic attacks by the Russians or to do or to use

383
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,000
 it for some kind of better damage assessment to see how efficient are the Russian attacks

384
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,500
 and we can also is also another point imagine that somebody on social media says a huge

385
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,000
 nuclear bomb or whatever has exploded somewhere you could also use this kind of stance to

386
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,680
 make some kind of fake news detection because if you have really really large damage event

387
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,000
 somewhere you could use these internet scans also to verify these kind of information are

388
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,320
 they really strongly hit is there really a large bombing whatever then we would see that

389
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,360
 in our data so you could also use this kind of approach for fake news detection in the

390
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:55,200
 end or for verification we have also learned that Ukraine internet consists of much more

391
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,480
 small ISPs compared to the Germany they are much more resilient because more than 50 percent

392
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,100
 of the end clients are are served by very small ISPs that serve less than one percent

393
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:15,840
 of the whole clients we can use the BGP data to understand who is trying to capture critical

394
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,440
 infrastructure special communication infrastructure and to route traffic through their own country

395
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,300
 for censorship for instance and we have also learned that we can use a black hole sensor

396
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:32,920
 network for understanding who is the victim in the Ukraine for a certain type of DDoS

397
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,760
 attacks and we have also seen that in the DDoS attacks we have investigated there is

398
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,800
 a some kind of campaign of campaigning because the attacks started every time on the first

399
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,520
 of the month and ended in the end of the month which shows us this is a some kind of foreign

400
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,280
 cyber campaign maybe behind it okay so this was my talk I thank you very much for your

401
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:08,800
 attention I know it was very hard and we do have a few minutes for questions please line

402
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:21,680
 up at the microphone countries in Europe are divided approximately equally right now in

403
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,960
 terms of which ones require registration of identity to obtain SIM cards and those that

404
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,960
 don't the Russo-Ukrainian war is between two powers on opposite ends of this spectrum and

405
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,600
 Ukraine no registration is required in the Russian Federation it is well this is less

406
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 relevant now as the Russian troops retreat early in the war Russian troops were obtaining

407
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,840
 Ukrainian SIM cards through looting and other measures that enables them to stay in touch

408
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 and coordinate because they were given inadequate radio signals equipment and one of the interesting

409
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,320
 questions at the time was how open source foreign open source intelligence operatives

410
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:10,080
 or the Ukrainian government could try to determine which cellular signals to intercept or disrupt

411
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,240
 given that no registration was available is this a problem you've encountered how would

412
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,240
 you recommend as a strategy in this theoretical scenario well so mobile network communications

413
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,920
 was not part of my talk it's a very it's it's a very good question but in the end I'm not

414
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,200
 expert for the mobile network communication I can just say from a network perspective

415
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,120
 that the mobile communications are mostly behind the network address translation and

416
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,480
 that and that you can't reach them via the scans very often so that's why they are out

417
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,800
 of my scope because I cannot scan them right so that's why I'm not dealing about I'm sorry

418
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,640
 I have no good question ma'am it's not my my subject hi thank you for the talk you mentioned

419
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,720
 this provider in cherson which is now gone do you have any indication what the clients

420
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,120
 of this provider are now doing have they switched to another one did you see any increase for

421
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,800
 in another isp a good question this is a very interesting point we have not investigated

422
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,160
 that but if you maybe give me later a card or contact information we can do this and

423
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,480
 and I can send you this right very good point so very often they have their own ranges and

424
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,520
 they are belong to the ripe and I think that the IP addresses are now dead until they get

425
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,600
 released by the ripe again because of course so that's that what I would think now but

426
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,040
 maybe we can identify some HTTPS certificates and can see where these servers I have maybe

427
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,040
 moved to another isp it's a very good idea we can investigate it very good point good

428
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,800
 idea hello and thank you for your talk I was very interesting I wanted to ask about the

429
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:53,400
 coordination like you scan like 400,000 IPs on Ukraine every four hours did you have any

430
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,280
 kind of coordination with them because it's a war right so I imagine from the other side

431
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,360
 they are trying to defend and then you're just hitting the things and not only you but like

432
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,920
 all the other companies right so did you do any coordination like these are our IPs like

433
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,160
 we are doing this sir it's so when you for instance when you go when you look who is

434
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,640
 the IP address who's scanning you can see it's IFA strike lab it's research net you

435
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,280
 have an abuse address when you email to the abuse address you get a complete answer about

436
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,800
 the research project we are doing technically it's like every four hours one packet per

437
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 system it's nothing right so it's it's yeah but but the traffic we issue is very it's

438
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:44,040
 it's just a sin a sin packet on HTTP on HTTPS it's it's it's it's really under the backscatter

439
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,240
 of all scanning we have all the time so it's like this is some kind of background noise

440
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,440
 all the time that's everybody everybody is getting everybody like that and this one packet

441
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,480
 every four hours they are they are not even identifying it we know so we got no compliance

442
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,760
 complaints on from Ukraine so that point it was like there was no Korean nation because

443
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,960
 there was no impact in the end and was also predicted by several be no impact okay hello

444
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,800
 thanks for the talk and I would assume that especially owners of static IP addresses have

445
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,680
 a quite professional hardware setup containing uninterruptible power supply of some sort

446
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,360
 so is it really that four hours accurate what you showed off or might there be a heavily

447
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,200
 impact because they might be able to power up from scratch even in the beginning of the

448
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,400
 war you're from Germany right yes yes okay very typically because that every 24 hour

449
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,800
 you get a new IP address is a very typical German stuff right so especially when you

450
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,600
 think on cable modems you have even now in Germany very often static IP addresses so

451
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:59,640
 I have also static IP address at my home so and especially when you go abroad having static

452
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,200
 IP addresses on a broadband connection it's very usual in the foreign countries so yes

453
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,760
 of course it's more likely that you have maybe more professional setup because each professional

454
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,520
 setup will have a static IP address but compared to to like standard DSL connections here in

455
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:24,200
 Germany and even they have now more than 24 hours a static IP address yes there could

456
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:31,840
 be a somehow small shift that will be more professional and we receive lower or maybe

457
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,860
 not that good results but when this effect would be really there then we wouldn't have

458
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:42,240
 seen like 90 percent power loss on the on the attacks in October right and because we have

459
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,120
 seen that I would say this is not a factor that impacts our result very much because

460
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,760
 the special equipment could be maximum 10 percent of our results because we have seen

461
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,280
 a drop on 90 percent and the 10 percent remaining have maybe professional equipment yes sure

462
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,080
 hey thanks for the talk I was wondering whether you have any insight and type of devices or

463
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,240
 the locality of the static IPs you are measuring so is it a representative sample of the Ukrainian

464
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,840
 infrastructure internet infrastructure yes so what we have done is we have looked for

465
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:23,160
 ISPs so we have seen that we have really from all ISPs a good sample rights and from all

466
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,080
 prefixes and so on so this it's not like we have four one hundred thousand IP addresses

467
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,560
 from like two ISPs that's something of course we have checked and that's a very good distribution

468
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,880
 across all ISPs and also across all locations in the Ukraine so yeah sure thank you very

469
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,760
 much very good question hi question previous reports on scanning the infrastructure send

470
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,520
 the reports to the Ukrainian government for approval before publishing did you ask them

471
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,680
 before publishing if you can so what we have done as I was on a conference from the Ministry

472
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,820
 for Foreign Affairs of Germany and there I have met the vice deputy for the Ministry

473
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,200
 of Communication and IT something like that and I talked to him and he said oh very interesting

474
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,340
 data please send it to me right so there was not so so for him it was not like it's very

475
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,720
 sensitive data or something like that and from our perspective I'm here in Germany and

476
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,280
 we have freedom of research and when I found out those very interesting results I want

477
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,360
 to publish it and to explain to people that you can use these very interesting types of

478
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,680
 data and this internet scanning stuff also to understand what goes up in the Ukraine

479
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,360
 also to fight against fake news and some other stuff right so that's so but in the end this

480
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:41,120
 I have there was no coordination because how you I cannot just pick up a phone say hi I'm

481
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,280
 Johannes Klick I want to talk with the vice president whatever and I want to internet

482
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,560
 scan it is okay for you that's not how it's how it's working right it's like I will get

483
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,000
 in a spam and then I wait for two hours and then it works right so that's but but nobody

484
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,280
 was complaining and it's so yeah there's a word of course yes and they they they have

485
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,120
 been very thankful for the insights because they have not been aware that we could have

486
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,400
 been able to measure that the second Russian attacks are less powerful than the first wave

487
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,920
 we have seen so in the end all Ukrainian guys I have talked to they have been very thankful

488
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,960
 for these very interesting insights and to prove that they have been more resilient against

489
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,560
 the Russian attacks that was all feedback I have received all the time thank you so much

490
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,000
 for your research I'm wondering are you able to see starlink devices are able to see people

491
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,200
 move to satellite internet or is this something that you're blind to so we have not investigated

492
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:43,320
 that so when the star like when you have a device that is it depends I have not investigated

493
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,160
 when they have IP addresses and known net network behind it you will have direct contact

494
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,040
 to these networks but very often satellite networks and other stuff is netted or like

495
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,440
 mobile communications but you have also every time the opportunity to have m2m connections

496
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,400
 machine to machine connections static IP addresses I don't know what the exact setup is I have

497
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,040
 not investigated starlink because a lot of other researchers concentrating on starlink

498
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,660
 and what's going up in Ukraine and I wanted to make other stuff in the end but it's still

499
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,000
 interesting so I can look up if you maybe find something and if I find no connection

500
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,040
 to starlink I would highly bet that they have a network address translation okay thank you

501
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,360
 good question thank you your house click thanks

502
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,360
