2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:32,520
 So now we have Sebastian, welcome.

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,480
 Sebastian is telling us about online selling without internet connection.

4
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,680
 >> Thank you.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
 Hello, how many of you?

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,000
 >> [INAUDIBLE]

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,280
 >> Now, yes.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,200
 How many of you use payment system, additional payment system?

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,720
 Raise your hand.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,800
 How many of you like free software?

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
 How many of you know the software that the payment system is running?

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,240
 Okay, nobody.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,560
 So how many of you know Nutaler already?

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,360
 Okay, couple of hands.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,240
 So this is not about talking about Nutaler, you must already know it.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,360
 But this is an update of what we are working on.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,280
 So we are working on local currency lastly.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,600
 This is how it works.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,200
 So from the wallet, you first follow the one who doesn't have a use yet, Nutaler.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,720
 You first withdraw the coins, you spend it, you get the ticket from the merchant,

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
 you spend it in the merchant with coins that are like the signature.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,840
 So you cannot link the withdrawal from the payment, so no one can trace you.

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
 What are you buying?

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,040
 And then the merchant make the deposit and

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,080
 get the cash back from the merchant bank account, right?

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,320
 So this is, I already know.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,960
 But we were thinking about if a merchant is going to be,

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,000
 like for example here, selling stuff and doesn't have internet connection.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,640
 How do you trust that the wallet did the payment if you cannot check online?

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,800
 So we found a solution, basically without too much saying.

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,280
 We are using a TOTP,

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,320
 code generator that the merchant has with a shared key with a merchant device.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,800
 So in the point of sales, you can check that the wallet's

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,880
 transaction has codes that are valid for the purchase.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,520
 So when the wallet pays, you get information for the merchant back office, right?

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,360
 And it has some verification code that can be validated with the merchant point of

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
 sale.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,800
 So as you can see here, the point of sales talks with the buyer,

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,840
 set the amounts, and it creates a contract that is going to be paid and

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,880
 generates the key that will generate the code that is going to be transferred to

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,120
 the point of sale.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,440
 If the point of sales validate that the code is the correct one,

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,280
 it checks that the purchase is real.

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,520
 So you can do that without the point of sale being online with the merchant.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,320
 So this is an example creating a QR code.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,080
 The merchant can create a QR code that is going to be put in the point of sales.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,200
 You set the description, the summary, and a fixed price.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 And then this is what can be printed in the point of sales.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
 So you can scan it when you roll it and pay it.

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,720
 >> [LAUGH]

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,360
 >> When you pay it with the wallet,

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,480
 you're going to see the confirmation of the transaction with these codes.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,000
 And these codes is what you can tell to the merchant to say, I made a purchase.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
 This is my code, okay, and the merchant can verify that because there is

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,520
 an OTP validator in the merchant device.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,320
 So there is no demo because there's too much thing happening right now.

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,000
 And we are going to be implementing this feature in the batch.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,880
 And I think the SoCo village is running a merchant and

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
 title exchange and we are trying to implement that so it can be tested.

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,800
 We also will be in the house of tea.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,000
 Every day at 3 PM we are going to be there just for talking about Tyler.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,240
 And also maybe a workshop to set up local currencies.

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960
 That's it.

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,360
 There is a lot of help wanted, testing, translations,

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
 also testing the deployments.

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,520
 That's it.

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,020
 Thank you.

68
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,400
