00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:39,240
 Nice to see you all again in this sun coming from the rear,

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,800
 grilling everybody.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,200
 Please still remember, drink more water and keep the walkways free.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,240
 As we talked so much already due to the power failure,

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,640
 sadly, neither on the stream nor on the recording.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,720
 I without further ado give it to Gabriella Coleman and

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,800
 to Jeremy Hammond to talk about activism.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,880
 >> Great, thanks so much.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,400
 >> [APPLAUSE]

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,800
 >> All right, so I'll be contextualizing

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,360
 the hack and leak, no surprise.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,640
 So I have a very specific definition for the hack and leak.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,360
 So it's a tactic executed by hacker outsiders who hack deliberately into

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,240
 some org server place to snatch documents and material.

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,560
 They publicize the intrusion, that's really important, and

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,760
 stolen material to drum up interest in the leaks.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,560
 It was initially used mainly for whistle blowing, but

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
 is now also used by different actors, like nation states, for different purposes.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,640
 I'll be concentrating more on this sort of hacktivist tactic.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,480
 Today, it's really a firm part of the hacktivist landscape.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,600
 Guacamaya, if you have not heard of them, are rocking the hack and

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
 leak in Latin America.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,240
 They hacked the Mexican military, for example.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,000
 And really since 2011 and 12, you really just have a tremendous amount of

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,120
 sort of hacktivist activity with this very deliberate tactic.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,000
 As I sort of mentioned after our technical snafu, this was so

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,200
 not obvious to put together the chocolate hack and

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,480
 the peanut butter leak and put them together.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,160
 And in fact, one of the fascinating things was that I interviewed for

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
 a very different project.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,040
 A lot of hackers who were like pwning and owning systems in the 90s and 2000s.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,720
 And many were not ideologically inclined to do hacktivism, but

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 some certainly were, and there were a lot of hacktivists doing also website

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
 defacements.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,440
 And one hacker actually from Europe during an interview said,

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,960
 I wish we had done something about it, but we didn't.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,800
 I think we could have exposed a lot of corruption, a lot of wrongdoing of a lot

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,240
 of high profile political people because they had access to their servers.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,040
 Now just to kind of give you a sense of how much more hacking and

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,360
 leaking we have, here's a list from 2010 to the present and it's partial.

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,320
 I could add another dozen examples.

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,480
 And before 2010, you've really got four in that sort of English speaking world,

45
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,000
 at least, and only two of them really kind of fit with my definition.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
 So as I mentioned, it was not obvious.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,920
 2009 is really the first instance where you have this tactic fully formed.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,440
 But what's interesting about the two, which I'll get to later,

49
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
 was that people didn't copycat them.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,680
 And it wasn't until anonymous hacktivists actually independently and

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,040
 accidentally stumbled upon this tactic that then it really started to

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,280
 cement into a template for emulation.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,240
 So here's a very truncated genealogy.

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,520
 So even though I sort of identify 2009 as the kind of time where this

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,120
 came into being, I often like to give analog examples.

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
 And there is a really amazing example of a group of activists,

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 the Citizens Commission to expose the FBI, who has heard of them.

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,920
 So a few, they actually broke into an FBI field office in media Pennsylvania,

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,720
 took like three, four suitcases of files, photocopied the documents,

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,760
 sent them to journalists, and eventually, co-intel pro,

61
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,360
 one of the most horrific sort of programs against activists was exposed.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
 And this is a kind of hack and leak.

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,080
 Obviously, it's very hard to break into a building and take documents, so

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,040
 that wasn't really replicated very often.

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,200
 Now, it wasn't until 2003 where you have something similar,

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,880
 where you have some big email dumps that were not from hacks.

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,480
 And one has to do with a deep old voting machine.

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,520
 Someone found documents and source code and

69
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
 email on unencrypted FTP server, took them.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,120
 And then some obscure government official kind of dumped the Enron emails,

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,880
 they were involved in fraud.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
 And these were super interesting because basically journalists could not be

73
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
 bothered to mind them, right?

74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,080
 And it took amazing amount of effort to even sort of cover the documents that

75
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,400
 were found.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,640
 In the case of D-Bold, for example, there were some stories about

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,800
 the vulnerabilities, but in this piece, actually,

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
 Paul Krugman is reflecting why the fuck didn't anyone go into the documents and

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,400
 emails and report on them.

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,680
 Now, going through email is a bitch.

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
 No one likes to do it.

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,000
 It's difficult.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,720
 You didn't really have boutique tech reporting as much as you did today.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
 So there's reasons for that, but

85
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,040
 I think it also shows that it really wasn't on people's mental map.

86
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,280
 So in 2009, you have two bona fide hacks and leaks.

87
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,800
 You have one against a university in England, and it was Climate Gate.

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,600
 And we don't know who took those emails.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
 They dumped them to kind of seed mistrust around climate science.

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,320
 And this got a lot of news.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,760
 It was all over the news.

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,680
 I'm not gonna talk about it.

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,520
 It didn't seem to inspire copycats.

94
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,800
 The second one was given to WikiLeaks and was signed anti-fascist hackers.

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,120
 And it was against Holocaust denier David Irving.

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,480
 And it did make a little bit of the press.

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,960
 And eventually, we learned that it was Jeremy Hammond.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,560
 He did it.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,040
 And this is, again, one of the first bona fide hacks and leaks.

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,760
 >> Fucking hack-nappy website.

101
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,280
 >> [APPLAUSE]

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,560
 Now what's so interesting is that eventually, I could sort of interview him about this stuff.

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,120
 And I sort of asked about, where did you get this idea?

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,240
 What was your sort of inspiration, right?

105
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,600
 It wasn't that one day he's like, here's the peanut butter, here's the chocolate,

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,560
 I'll put it together.

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,640
 He was part of the hacker underground.

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,160
 And there was a cultural movement called Antisec.

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
 Who here heard of Antisec?

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,680
 Not the recent one, but the one from early 2000s.

111
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
 Yeah, Antisec won.

112
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 Very few people.

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,080
 So in the early 2000s, a bunch of hackers who were part of the underground were

114
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
 professionalizing, they were getting jobs.

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,200
 And there was a small crew of people who were like, screw that,

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
 we wanna preserve our cultural kingdom.

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,640
 We want our exploits and vulnerabilities.

118
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,520
 So they went on a rampage against white hat hackers.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,360
 And what they did was they hacked them, took their emails, dumped them, but

120
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,840
 not for whistle blowing, it was just for shaming them, right?

121
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,480
 And Jeremy was like, that's badass, but maybe we can reformulate that and

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,160
 reformat that for political purposes.

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,160
 And initially, he would take emails and then share them with a small network of

124
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
 people, not publicly.

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 And it wasn't till the WikiLeaks era where again,

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,200
 the chocolate and peanut butter came together.

127
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,480
 So he did this in 2009, he's on probation, very independently.

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,400
 Anonymous comes into being, and very accidentally,

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
 I don't have the time to go into the details.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 They start to stumble on emails, into emails, sometimes not through hacks,

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,160
 sometimes through hacks, and it's all over the news.

132
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,200
 Jeremy's on the sidelines, he's super excited.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,160
 At a certain point, he's like, I can't help myself, I'm gonna kind of join.

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,360
 And he does when LulzSec is disbanding, and very deliberately creates Antisec,

135
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,800
 a kind of new version, where you're really deliberately hacking and

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,120
 leaking and some side of sabotage as well.

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 Doing things like fuck FBI Fridays,

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,680
 where you try to time a hack and leak every Friday.

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
 So that's a very brief genealogy.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,000
 There's lots of interesting things else to say.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,800
 But in 2012, a lot of people get arrested, and

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,720
 it's not really clear whether this would continue, right?

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,600
 It's all over the news, but are people gonna basically copycat it, right?

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
 And I wasn't sure myself.

145
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,280
 I myself at this point also thought this tactic existed since the 1980s.

146
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,200
 I took it for granted.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,840
 In 2014, the answer came with LulzSec Peru, with Phineas Fisher.

148
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,480
 Then you also have Guardians of Peace, which is a nation state group, right?

149
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,760
 So the tactic begins to morph, but

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,280
 it really starts to grow some serious roots into the ground.

151
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,440
 And what is also interesting, and

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,920
 I'm wrapping up so that we could turn over to Jeremy, is that you have

153
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,840
 groups like Phineas Fisher, who are not quite as visible.

154
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,800
 They're not there doing 50 days of hacking in a row.

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,080
 They're striking maybe one year or a few times, then in 2016 for

156
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,000
 a few more times, but they're writing manifestos with extremely detailed

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,600
 instructions for how not to get caught, right?

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
 And indeed, whether it's Phineas Fisher or Guacamea,

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,240
 now we have this tactic where these groups, individuals,

160
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,360
 who knows who are doing this, but evading capture.

161
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,760
 So that's all I'm gonna say.

162
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,120
 If you're interested in the 40 page version, feel free to email me.

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,080
 But otherwise, I'm now gonna turn it over to Jeremy for his bit.

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,640
 Thank you.

165
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,840
 >> [APPLAUSE]

166
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
 >> Okay.

167
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,620
 >> Okay.

168
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,560
 >> Beale, you're the best.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
 >> I've been learning this for a long time.

170
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,080
 I was just learning it myself, learning it by doing basically.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,800
 I'm a back encoder and I'm pretty skilled at remote intrusion, but

172
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,760
 I'm not actually particularly the best, right?

173
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,160
 None of us are, but what I found is that how many 15 million security

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,520
 contractors are there that could be a potential Snowden but ain't?

175
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,040
 Because in the United States, a lot of tech workers and

176
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,160
 developers are basically complicit with the system.

177
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,040
 How do I full screen this shit?

178
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,000
 This is very embarrassing.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,480
 >> [LAUGH] >> I don't use PowerPoint, right?

180
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,000
 My God.

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,620
 Command F.

182
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,160
 So anyways, white hats.

183
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,580
 My God.

184
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:14,260
 Thunderbird?

185
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,560
 All right, so what to do?

186
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,720
 This is also single slides, but I can just do it on mine.

187
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,220
 Sorry about this.

188
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:34,520
 There we go.

189
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,080
 All right, let's burn some shit.

190
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,800
 So it's time to draw a line of the sand.

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,200
 And it's time for hackers to develop some class consciousness.

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,320
 Occupy Wall Street, we're the 99%.

193
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,880
 But there's obviously intersectionalities and so forth.

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,720
 And I think honestly we've been a little bit too patient with those who are

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,080
 complicit with the corporate security.

196
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,840
 These professionals are harmless now.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,040
 Now granted, I am so inspired by what y'all have built here.

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,640
 I wish we could do the same thing in the United States where it's desperately

199
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,880
 needed.

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,040
 But what we have right now, how things have changed,

201
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
 I just got a smartphone like two years for the first time when I got out of prison.

202
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,480
 I was on all these ridiculous monitoring shits.

203
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,720
 And I was just coming to terms with the rise of big tech and

204
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,880
 what Corey Doctorow calls in shitification and

205
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,160
 all these new complex ideologies that test creals like the Musks and

206
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,040
 the Peter Thiels and this crypto stuff.

207
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,880
 This futures and where those are left behind.

208
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,160
 And all this Panopticon surveillance stuff would only be made possible by

209
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,440
 those developers who had chose the paycheck over principle.

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,360
 And so, and hackers, the vision of information was just free.

211
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
 We'd all just result in this utopian, but

212
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,560
 unfortunately was not able to contend with the forces of neoliberal capitalism,

213
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,720
 which is a masterful recuperation of hackers.

214
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 That's why you see hack labs turn to hacker spaces and now maker spaces and

215
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,280
 stuff like that and DefCon and so forth, right?

216
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,000
 So it's time to make hacking a threat again.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,600
 >> [APPLAUSE]

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
 >> I love those little fishes, man.

219
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,280
 But hey, so these are some tips and stuff like that that I thought what were our

220
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,960
 strengths that made work.

221
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,680
 Anonymity, encryption, ops, compartmentalization, need to know.

222
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,760
 I will say that the reasons why I've been busted at any of these times is not

223
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
 because of any of the failures of the technology itself.

224
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,000
 First off, shout out to the Tor project.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,160
 I relied on that shit for nine months and that's not how they caught me.

226
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,440
 I made my own mistakes by running my mouth mostly and trusting people and so

227
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
 forth, but encryption works.

228
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
 Al Snowden said it himself.

229
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,400
 But if you just need to be precise though, of course, right?

230
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,600
 What also works is memetic action.

231
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,520
 Replicable action, creating openings, be like water like they said in Hong Kong,

232
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,160
 I believe.

233
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,840
 Basically, I've worked in a lot of protests and organizations and so forth, right?

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,240
 And I'm an anarchist, but so we have a criticism of centralized and

235
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
 hierarchical organizational structures and I think the future is more memetic

236
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,520
 action. I think that's one of anonymous' strengths is to learn how to the virality.

237
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,040
 And also because you don't have to wait to do it yourself.

238
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,440
 You could just be inspired.

239
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,880
 If you see something, it recognizes it.

240
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
 Like I have some examples down here.

241
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,560
 Stuff like graffiti, raves, flash mobs, hopping and turnstile, team takeovers and

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,840
 so forth.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,800
 Or like in Chicago, we have like these team takeovers, these slides where people

244
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,960
 just have these spontaneous public gatherings and so forth.

245
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,400
 That just, it's guerrilla stuff, hit and run.

246
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
 Diversity of tactics.

247
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,040
 You know, there's no one way to do it.

248
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,720
 There's many ways.

249
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,200
 There's many worlds.

250
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,600
 You know, sometimes you have to know what card to play at the right moment.

251
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,080
 Sometimes it's just got to boil over though and you got to take action.

252
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,360
 But I came up handing flyers and going to anti-war protests and stuff like that and

253
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
 thinking possibly naively that you could change things by that the people in power

254
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,680
 will be willing to listen to you or they'll be able to, you could achieve reforms

255
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,280
 through this system.

256
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,720
 It took my head being whacked by batons.

257
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,560
 It took a lot of time in jail and a lot of bogus charges in jail.

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
 Sometimes it is, sometimes it didn't do it though.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,240
 And I had to learn that the whole thing just has to go completely.

260
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,720
 Right?

261
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,920
 And so direct action, hey, it gets the goods, baby.

262
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,080
 There's a lot of activism though.

263
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,360
 You know, you don't all have to, we don't all got to be the hero to break stuff.

264
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,160
 You know, we choose our own level of involvement.

265
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,000
 We're all not uniquely positioned in our lives.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,800
 Again, there's all forms of defensive hacktivism.

267
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,000
 These hacker spaces creating these incubations and developing software and

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,200
 audits are all part of this diversity of tactics.

269
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,480
 Decentralized deterrence, discourage recruitment of cops, law enforcement,

270
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,960
 white hats.

271
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
 If they thought, first off, a cop shouldn't be able to get a bar in any fucking place,

272
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,120
 you know, anywhere, they shouldn't, you know, if white hats were like that too,

273
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,520
 maybe we'd have less white hats developing the hacking team spy shit,

274
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,840
 the surveillance, all that.

275
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,040
 So Antisec, big fan, we chose targeting the white hats as the weak link because

276
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
 also, first off, their emails, they got the credentials, they got the live

277
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,040
 vulnerabilities, they got the keys to the kingdom.

278
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,960
 So we're after that shit.

279
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,560
 Get the mail, get it all.

280
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,200
 All right.

281
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,520
 Mistakes were made.

282
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,560
 But they didn't stop us from learning our lessons and moving on.

283
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,880
 You know, my first time I hacked a protest wire is like a right wing counter

284
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,960
 counter protester thing.

285
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
 They were kind of like doxing us.

286
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,920
 And like Biela had said, a lot of the work I was doing was a lot of anti-fascist

287
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,880
 work, knowing and mapping the right wing networks.

288
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,160
 And again, like hacking that, all of it has to be spectacular front page news

289
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,720
 defacement.

290
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,000
 Sometimes it's like quietly and listen, right?

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,920
 And knowing where to distribute that data to those that matter.

292
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,200
 You know, we need to know who these Nazis are in our neighborhoods.

293
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
 We need to know their connections, whether they are also police officers or

294
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,240
 work in security themselves or generally.

295
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,560
 And also it works.

296
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,240
 You know what I mean?

297
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,720
 So the David Irving one, I went after that because he was on a speaking tour.

298
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,760
 And we did the secret location and all this type of stuff.

299
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,320
 And so we were able to hack his emails, get all the meeting locations he had to

300
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,680
 cancel it.

301
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,600
 Also the attendees, those who attended, these neo-Nazis and so forth.

302
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 So now I chose to release it to WikiLeaks because that was a stable platform that

303
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 was at the time that distributed no questions asked, right?

304
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,560
 And so it's like, you know, it's one of the difficult things for those who are

305
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,600
 breaking in, whether it's physically, like the example you had mentioned, or

306
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,920
 digitally, like.

307
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,200
 But fortunately, y'all are fucking the greatest because there's now many

308
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,920
 distributed distribution systems, D.secours, of course, right?

309
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,640
 Anyways, back to this.

310
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,160
 Imprecise and undisciplined technical execution, like you've got to be on point,

311
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,040
 right?

312
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,480
 You know, hacking and stuff is like you grind it.

313
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,240
 They're doing it for the paycheck, nine to five, but we're all night online,

314
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,440
 baby.

315
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,720
 You know what I mean?

316
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,120
 We just need to find that one mistake, right?

317
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,880
 But the reverse is true because you also have to be 100% accurate 100% of the time.

318
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,080
 And you might get away with it or so you thought, but years later, man, that log

319
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,840
 file or whatever the fuck they did, come get your ass.

320
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,800
 So just be precise.

321
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
 Persistent identities and crossing streams.

322
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360
 Crossing streams, OK, so I hacked this site.

323
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,160
 I was, you know, using aliases tied to my name.

324
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 I was young and I know what the hell I was doing.

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,640
 But while at the same time also breaking into shit and then people are just

326
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,440
 obviously able to see two and two together because I did not

327
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,480
 compartmentalize my life and it was very easy for them to get.

328
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 So you can't really do above ground and underground stuff at the same time.

329
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,800
 I mean, you can, but we all have a little bit of multiple personality stuff.

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
 But persistent identities.

331
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,000
 During anonymous, I attempted to have multiple a dozen nicknames or something

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,080
 like that change at a different time and place, you know, and, you know,

333
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,000
 if you do a hack, it's not really a good idea to use the same identity over and

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
 over and over again because you keep them guessing, right?

335
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,120
 It's best to keep them guessing that they don't know.

336
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,680
 Unfortunately, I was talking to an informant who knew all the nicknames

337
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,120
 anyways, or didn't even really matter in my case.

338
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,840
 But that has to do with more of a choice about whether I chose to involve myself

339
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,560
 with a larger phenomenon and get involved publicly.

340
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,960
 We'll talk more about the to crew or not to crew later.

341
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,680
 Leaders, hierarchies and pyramids, right?

342
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
 You know, we already know all that.

343
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,240
 Ambiguous politics.

344
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,960
 I would say it's nice to know who you're getting involved with and know where you

345
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,800
 stand and let others know how you would react to a situation politically.

346
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,880
 Occupy Wall Street was the 99 percent, but then you'd also have like a lot of

347
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,440
 right wing tea partiers and even folks who believe that the cops are part of

348
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 the 99 percent too.

349
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,640
 And so again, they had to wait until they got kicked out of a dozen cities by

350
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,480
 force by the police until they, oh, wait a minute, they're not on it, right?

351
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,720
 No connection to local struggles.

352
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
 Hacktivist actions are really, you can't just like parachute in and think that you

353
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,640
 know what a local struggle or those who are being oppressed by some type of

354
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
 corporation or government is going to do.

355
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
 We're just going to come in and save the day.

356
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,400
 You know, I mean, you really do have to understand the context and get involved

357
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
 to see what folks actually want.

358
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,160
 This the synergy of activism hacking is at those little intersections of Venn

359
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,640
 diagrams is when you really are effective, though.

360
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,040
 And it's there's in the United States is actually not that much overlap between

361
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
 hacking and from my personal perspective.

362
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,720
 You know, I've been to those 26 hundreds and they they just ain't into it.

363
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,320
 They're saying into it.

364
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
 You talk talk about anti-fascism to be like, oh, that's good.

365
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,800
 It's extremely real.

366
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
 I don't do that.

367
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,640
 Other problems, exclusivity, elitism, not sharing the knowledge and fun.

368
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,600
 And like I'm a black head.

369
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,200
 I understand.

370
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
 Don't publish exploit code.

371
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
 Don't keep it private.

372
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,320
 I respect it.

373
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,520
 But also like we can't keep this specialized and insular direct action.

374
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,160
 We need to show.

375
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,200
 And so like like Biela had said, Phineas and the Decepticons, I believe not only

376
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,840
 do they hack some shit and leak some shit, they've also published DIY guides

377
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,760
 to showing first off how easy it is and that you could do it yourself, that

378
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,520
 you don't need to wait.

379
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
 Working within the system, you already know.

380
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
 We ain't doing all that.

381
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,720
 All right.

382
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
 I just do this and mistakes are made.

383
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,920
 I didn't really intend to talk in detail about how I was caught.

384
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,520
 But I just do these couple slides here.

385
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,920
 Just talk the tour correlation attack is with an informant.

386
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,120
 But we'll talk about that later.

387
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
 If you want to see me on a Saturday, come on.

388
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,920
 We'll go on to how upset could go horribly wrong.

389
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,720
 Here's some more fashion tips for the brave.

390
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 This black so they reduce identifying.

391
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,920
 This is more of a physical.

392
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,120
 But it also I thought it might have some analog stuff too, because you know,

393
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
 writing in these RSC chat rooms and publishing press releases.

394
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,120
 I'm always curious to see how these intelligence agencies like use language

395
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,920
 analysis and so forth to identify and tie together stuff.

396
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,520
 Or if you smash the window lately, well, like don't be wearing these the same

397
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,320
 sneaks that you'd be wearing all the time to catch your ass.

398
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
 And they do.

399
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
 They do one mistake.

400
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,920
 So this is right because these motherfuckers have mastered the counterinsurgency.

401
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,120
 They know how to manage resistance and recuperate.

402
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,520
 So and they did so.

403
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,720
 With anonymous and a lot of it has to do with maybe a little weakness of the

404
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,320
 open nature of decentralized communities, right?

405
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
 They have just these chat rooms with thousands of people, you know,

406
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,920
 who's in their logging, of course, informants, of course, entrapment that

407
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,120
 we could talk a little bit about that as well later.

408
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,920
 But they also try to discredit those who are working hard on the right shit.

409
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,120
 They'll just go share co-option.

410
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,720
 They'll try to I have a list down here.

411
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,120
 The Dutch and formula, the divide and conquer other side of the coin are a few

412
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,720
 good papers that talk about some of the different things that they're doing.

413
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
 A few good papers that talk about some of the different divide and conquer

414
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,920
 strategies, mostly between isolating good and bad protesters,

415
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,920
 whatever the hell that means, or even try to reduce it to a narrative of law

416
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,120
 in order of criminality, like oh, we could have got to be legal or we have to be

417
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,520
 pacifist is the only way the one way or like that.

418
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,720
 And so one of the strategies, they isolate the radicals.

419
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,320
 They call us criminals.

420
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,920
 They call us. But listen, what I found is that I was handing out flyers and

421
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
 news will get my head beaten.

422
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,720
 They still call me a terrorist.

423
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
 I didn't even do that terrorist shit till many years later because they made me.

424
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,120
 They made me a government corporate fascist co-opting the tactics and

425
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,920
 aesthetics of hackers and revolutionaries.

426
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,720
 We're seeing this with QAnon like they're trying to say that is the

427
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
 type of lineage. There's obviously no lineage, but they like the aesthetics of

428
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
 rebellion and resistance.

429
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,120
 I always think it's hilarious for right put rage against the machine as example

430
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,320
 because all these like anti-vax or right wingers and stuff might just hear it for

431
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,520
 the first time because you know, they only know what the hell to do it and they

432
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,720
 think that is then they wait.

433
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
 These are commies. These are fucking lefties.

434
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,520
 What the fuck is like, what the fuck Marjorie Taylor Greene was selling defund the FBI

435
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 shirts right, but there's or right wing thinking that like they're now trying to

436
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,720
 claim the mantle of free speech and stuff like that because they got fucking

437
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
 kicked off at Twitter.

438
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,120
 How about you fucking try a month in the box because you posted some shit on

439
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,720
 Twitter or how about you write a letter to your fucking judges sentencing and

440
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,120
 stuff like that.

441
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
 They take your email privileges away for fucking months, right?

442
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,520
 You know, try just doing handing leaflets and get your ass whooped and not these

443
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,720
 motherfuckers complaining about Twitter and stuff.

444
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,520
 And then of course like Bielat had mentioned the hacked state and governments

445
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,120
 also are now adopting the hacking leaks themselves, right?

446
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,720
 Full circle I suppose.

447
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 You know, there's a Vault 7 revelation showed how also the US CIA specifically

448
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,220
 has tools that could misattribute a hack and make it appear like it comes from

449
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,720
 somewhere else.

450
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,520
 And then they try to muddy the waters too also with this Hunter Biden laptop and

451
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 the DNC and stuff like that.

452
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,220
 So they're learning that some things are effective and in a way that it's a little

453
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,920
 bit more honest in a sense that they're not even they're dropping the pretense of

454
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,520
 law and order because democracy is a sham in the first place and now they're doing

455
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,320
 the same shit we are like at least in the United States they're just it's best past

456
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,920
 the breaking point.

457
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,120
 Alright, just some critiques of leaking is not enough.

458
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,820
 Like Bielat said, a lot of the work is honestly the journalism digging through

459
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,520
 the databases.

460
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,920
 You know what I mean?

461
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,520
 Like, okay, you could hack some shit and get like 80 gigs of emails and SQLs

462
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,020
 and stuff like that.

463
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,120
 Like, you know, who has time?

464
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,620
 You know, when I was at my height, I had like hundreds and hundreds of targets,

465
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:22,720
 man.

466
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,820
 It's one of the reasons why I chose to go with WikiLeaks to release the Stratford

467
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,420
 emails because they had teams of professionals and journalists to be able to go through

468
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,520
 and look and find the stories to find the scandals because destroying is great.

469
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,820
 I mean, believe it and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

470
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,420
 But leaking is kind of has a long-term scandals that could make or break a presidency

471
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,320
 or aspiring right-wing politicians career.

472
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,820
 So deep-ancing the empire.

473
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,920
 Can I give one example?

474
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,620
 Yes.

475
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:57,420
 In Lulsec, Peru hacked the government and they released emails that showed massive

476
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,720
 corruption and then they were voting to disintegrate the government and they didn't

477
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
 but they needed one more vote to do so.

478
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,220
 So making a difference.

479
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,120
 You could shape public perception and consciousness of the problem by exposing it.

480
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,020
 And as outsiders, we're a little bit different from whistleblowers.

481
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,220
 You know, I mean, I've never we're not military.

482
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,120
 We're not law enforcement.

483
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,320
 You know, I mean, we're they're holding all the keys like in their little fortress and

484
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,820
 stuff like that.

485
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,520
 But again, if a smart person knows where to look to find the cracks in the windows and

486
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,620
 the doors, right and find that shit and release it.

487
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,020
 Okay, leaking is not enough.

488
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
 Lack of stable distribution platforms in the early days.

489
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,220
 But fortunately now, I think a little bit is better now with Torrance and you know,

490
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,620
 a lot of the technology all developed.

491
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,720
 A problem is over-saturation and desensitization.

492
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,420
 So like in the early days, like it was a revelation that, you know, you have like a police

493
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,920
 chief email sending races stuff like that and you could get a fire.

494
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,720
 But now there's just they're muddying the water.

495
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,820
 But by dumping so much fake news and disinfo that is hard to distinguish reality.

496
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,620
 And so now it's just a everyone's perception is, you know, we all know it.

497
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,720
 Diffusion by disinfo limits whistleblowing.

498
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,920
 So yeah, a lot of whistleblowers, you know, who work within like these governments and

499
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 stuff like that.

500
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,220
 First off, we do need to create incentives because we do want to welcome those.

501
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,520
 A lot of them do have like these once they see the dirt.

502
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,420
 Maybe the few of them do join these things with the good intentions.

503
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,220
 Maybe not police, bullies and so forth.

504
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,180
 But nevertheless, maybe they have a crisis of conscience and we need to create welcoming

505
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,420
 environments to where they could we could embrace them.

506
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,920
 But nevertheless, oftentimes I found that they have lingering allegiances and a belief

507
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,780
 that you could still appeal to the authorities by, you know, there's like whistleblower programs

508
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,820
 with the government like, oh, they'll protect you.

509
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
 But you know what?

510
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,660
 You know, look what they did to the ones who tried, you know, they prosecute and threaten

511
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,000
 and discredit and all the rest.

512
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,320
 And so I found that that resulted in a lot of half measures.

513
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,420
 And also, I don't remember if I talked, okay, I'll talk about it later.

514
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,680
 And then liberal media is complicit as well because either they're not going to be covering

515
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,880
 it unless they have to.

516
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,640
 Like for example, the Pentagon Papers, you know, or even Chelsea Manning went to several

517
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,160
 reporting agencies and tried to release them, but they weren't trying to hear none of that,

518
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 right?

519
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
 So they're kind of part of the problems.

520
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,800
 That's why we need like independent DIY journalism and stuff like that.

521
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 This is where you all come in.

522
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,820
 Unfortunately, leaking, I would say, has not stopped the death march because now that we

523
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,140
 are aware of it, we all know government is spying on us.

524
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,360
 They're going to war and stuff like that.

525
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,800
 So just the knowledge of this fact, we've all known that, right?

526
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,520
 So we need to make hacking a threat again.

527
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,480
 Towards a more effective hacktivism, right?

528
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,240
 So you know, again, like we can all be the warriors.

529
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,480
 I would say that is extremely important that you know exactly what you're looking at before

530
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,820
 you even get involved in it and also let those who are around you know what your limitations

531
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,680
 are before you get involved.

532
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,360
 And then also, it's super important to practice prisoner solidarity for those comrades got locked

533
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,140
 up in the line of duty.

534
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,020
 Now first, I want to shout out chaos camp because I got a lot of postcards from this camp years

535
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,600
 ago and it meant everything to me.

536
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
 It meant everything to me.

537
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:58,560
 I'm so, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here with you all.

538
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,360
 I think they are still also doing a jailed to the mail thing.

539
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,040
 I mean, if I was talking about, so there's still lots of folks locked up behind bars.

540
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,540
 And I will say enacting prisoner solidarity is not as important also because it emboldens

541
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,440
 the next line of those who were willing to thinking about whether they take the adventure

542
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
 because you are not alone.

543
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 You will have a movement that got your back.

544
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
 And we'll see you through.

545
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,960
 We'll see you through the other end, right?

546
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
 So study court documents.

547
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,080
 You know, the discovery, the indictments, read that shit, study the forensic reports,

548
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,640
 the advisers, see how they're caught.

549
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,640
 I threw in here reject law and order, the framing of ethical hacking.

550
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,560
 Yeah, we all know this shit, right?

551
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,680
 This is the big one though, know if and when to pull the trigger.

552
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,400
 Like I alluded to it earlier, but you know, not always it's a good idea to release immediately

553
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
 or attack immediately.

554
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,360
 For one, I would say this is one of the, when I first started getting anonymous and started

555
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,480
 looking at them, it was so amazing and inspiring because they're getting some big targets off

556
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,000
 the rip, but there's an IRC, OSHA, SQA, StateGov, Wendeface, Wendeface.

557
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
 I was like, nah, you got to go through the emails.

558
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,520
 You got to test all those hashes.

559
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,440
 You know, you got to probe and get all the mails at least.

560
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,120
 If you ain't got the mails, you know, before you pull the trigger.

561
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,000
 But then again, you can't wait too long either because of course the window might close.

562
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,240
 Less spectacle and more damage.

563
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,160
 All right, now smashing a window, it shatters the myth of law and order and creates openings

564
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,080
 in which another world is possible.

565
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,560
 But spectacle is great.

566
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
 Defacements are great.

567
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
 But man, why don't you just RMR off that shit?

568
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
 You know what I mean?

569
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 Destroy that shit.

570
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,880
 Stratford, it took them like six weeks because I deleted like four servers completely, DD

571
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 and shit like.

572
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,600
 So a defacement that might take down, but damage is forever, baby.

573
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,540
 Less redactions and more doxing.

574
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,680
 So I put this in because I was kind of a little bit frustrated that for example, the Snowden

575
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,120
 dox that released all these slides of like the NSA slides and all the prisms and all this

576
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
 stuff, right?

577
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,840
 They didn't even release the names of the NSA agents or whoever fucking wrote them.

578
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 Why the hell not?

579
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
 Why the hell not?

580
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
 Release that shit, man.

581
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,160
 Like first off, in a lot of places around the world, police officers and stuff like that,

582
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,520
 you should be known and we shouldn't have police in the first place.

583
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 All cops are bastards.

584
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,440
 But it would be a thing to know who they are.

585
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,840
 So what are you so, but nevermind.

586
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
 Docs their addresses and all that shit.

587
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,840
 I will say though that you do have to go with the data because it's a lot of responsibility

588
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 to be sitting on.

589
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,280
 I was hacking a lot of police stuff like that and I'd have emails and stuff like that.

590
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,400
 And for example, they would have jail rosters of people who are incarcerated in these jails

591
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,480
 and people who are not even convicted of a crime for example, or also possibly victim

592
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,440
 witness statements and so forth of domestic violence that we don't necessarily want to,

593
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,520
 obviously we don't want to expose that stuff because, so you do have a tremendous responsibility

594
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,560
 to parse through that data, which is again, a lot of the work when you hack some 80 gigs

595
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
 of emails and shit.

596
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,440
 Oh man, I need a team for this.

597
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,880
 But there's no crew, only you.

598
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
 Don't wait either.

599
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,760
 But that's why there's like these networks.

600
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,400
 We have these journalism networks and WikiLeaks and alternatives to WikiLeaks, how we do this.

601
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,040
 And don't be afraid to be the first.

602
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 Don't be afraid to go all the way.

603
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,800
 I will say this, when I started getting arrested and something like, my first time I had 5,000

604
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,440
 credit cards, didn't use a single one.

605
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,600
 I talked about using a little bit, oh we're going to donate to all these causes that they

606
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 hate.

607
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,960
 It would be great to charities and comic groups and stuff like that, but I didn't use them.

608
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
 But they still charged me as if I did it anyways.

609
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,480
 And they gave me the sentencing gullet, 5,000 credit cards, $500, two and a half million dollars

610
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,080
 in damages six years over the statutory maximum.

611
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,880
 Anyways, come on man, they're going to sentence you as if you did it anyways, so you may as

612
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
 well go all the way.

613
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,680
 Hell, half the time I've been arrested, half the time, yeah, you already know man.

614
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,640
 And that's really all I have to say to be honest.

615
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
 That's it.

616
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,360
 We're down for questions.

617
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 Please hit it.

618
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 I'm an open book.

619
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
 I'm here all week, so hit it.

620
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:34,720
 So there's plenty of time for questions.

621
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,400
 I will help moderate them.

622
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,760
 Jeremy?

623
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:47,600
 Is there a microphone?

624
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,080
 Yeah.

625
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,920
 Stand over here because we need to be in the camera shot.

626
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,400
 Oh hi, I will never thank you enough for all you've done in your entire life.

627
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,400
 I love you so much, both of you.

628
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 I have a short comment.

629
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,160
 I'll make it short and I have a question for you.

630
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,680
 We heard 2009, we heard Wikileaks name three times, we heard Vault 7, but you mentioned

631
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,500
 Wikileaks as a platform, a bunch of journalists.

632
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,240
 My comment is that to me Wikileaks also taught the world how to do journalism and data journalism,

633
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,760
 taught the world how to do anti-censorship publishing and not just a platform.

634
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,240
 Also Wikileaks taught us about source protection.

635
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,160
 Now I haven't heard the name of Assange in your talk and when the camp ended four years

636
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,600
 ago he was mentioned because four years ago he was fucking arrested and he's still in

637
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,400
 the worst prison in the UK for nothing today.

638
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,640
 So I wanted to ask you, does this case of this violent character assassination campaign

639
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:09,600
 with this fake doctored accusations, the Niels Melser, the UN reporter, demonstrated that

640
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,320
 the Swedish rape case was fabricated?

641
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,820
 This and the rest, is that the same tactics to discredit, to divide and the such that you

642
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,800
 mentioned earlier?

643
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:27,440
 And is there a US bias in the perception of the character of Assange that prevents the

644
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,880
 unified and justified campaign of support that he and Wikileaks and everybody else in

645
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
 Wikileaks deserves?

646
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
 I could talk about the liberal media.

647
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:48,720
 Well for one, for you Julian Assange and all political prisoners, all prisoners just saying.

648
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,800
 Thanks for the question, it's a very heavy one, right?

649
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,600
 I will say this, it's true like we mentioned earlier that the United States especially

650
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,520
 uses the campaigns to discredit those who stand up, the nail that stands up gets hammered

651
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
 down.

652
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,760
 But it is also true that there is a history of patriarchy and sexual abuse that anyone

653
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,000
 is capable of doing it and it is disappointing and people need to be held accountable for

654
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 their...

655
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,340
 I can't comment on the specifics of the Assange, but I will say also that one thing I like

656
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,940
 about the new generation of whistle blowing platforms is that it is not necessarily centered

657
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,080
 around personalities or individuals, which that's why I mentioned earlier the martyrdom

658
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,000
 thing is that because it's a failure, we all fail, right?

659
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,840
 And Wikileaks lists a lot of examples, I'm not even specifically referring to Assange

660
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
 here.

661
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,900
 So I'm just saying that it has a way of lessening the problem of these abusers in our organizations

662
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,240
 if we don't centralize power in that way.

663
00:33:52,240 --> 00:34:02,120
 And I could speak to the kind of bias against Assange in his case in the United States and

664
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
 the liberal media.

665
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,520
 I think you're absolutely right and I think it runs enormously deep for a couple of reasons.

666
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,600
 I mean one of which is absolutely, you're right, that the American media in different

667
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,480
 moments of its history has been extremely spineless, completely spineless.

668
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,480
 And in fact, the Citizens Commission to expose the FBI, the Washington Post published the

669
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,440
 story but they did not want to.

670
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,720
 They did not want to, the New York Times didn't want to, a bunch of editors convinced Katherine

671
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,000
 Graham to release the information.

672
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,520
 At the time that Wikileaks came into being, you had Chelsea Manning who wanted to show

673
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,160
 collateral murder, Reuters knew about that fucking video, they had seen it and they would

674
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,600
 not publish, right?

675
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,880
 And it was so important to have that platform.

676
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:58,000
 And I think because in some ways, like if I was some Freudian, Lacanian psychoanalyst,

677
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,900
 which I'm not, I think there's something really interesting about how Assange basically showed

678
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,640
 how spineless the American media was.

679
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,160
 Then things went sour, you know, and then it's insane to me because I've definitely

680
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,760
 have done events around Assange and you know there have been a lot of people who have come

681
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,760
 out and supported it but it's not receiving the attention it needs because that is a threat

682
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,120
 to journalism, he does not deserve that.

683
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,360
 So I really appreciate your question and Wikileaks is a key part of the story that we're telling.

684
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,960
 But yeah, absolutely in many deep ways.

685
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,000
 I will say also that they tried to, you know, when they held me in contempt and wanted me

686
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,320
 to testify saying Assange was like, he asked you, he was paying you, whatever, he was like,

687
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,760
 just because I don't necessarily agree with some of the Trump stuff earlier that I didn't

688
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,760
 agree with, but that doesn't mean I still said fuck you, I ain't saying shit motherfucker,

689
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:59,680
 free the man, free the man.

690
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,360
 We have five minutes, so questions, comments?

691
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,880
 We have a crisis of journalism that is we're almost past facts so nobody believes in anything

692
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
 anymore.

693
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:19,920
 So how can journalism still expose stuff if no one believes anything anyway?

694
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,680
 I think there is an objective truth.

695
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,760
 You know what I mean?

696
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,480
 Despite their attempts to muddy the water with disinfo in this post-truth society, you're

697
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,540
 right, you're right, that's why I said leaking may not be enough.

698
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,880
 That's why, you know, if you get the docs, post it, yes, and maybe we can and we should

699
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,560
 push hard to hold these people accountable once we find their information, right?

700
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,920
 But you're right because then they could also create a counter narrative that just makes

701
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
 shit up.

702
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,160
 So that's why I say just delete their shit or just stalk them outside of the house or

703
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,760
 do what you need to do, but they should not be around working military no more if you

704
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,080
 know what you know about them.

705
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,760
 I also, I'm an anthropologist and we sort of, our bread and butter is conspiracy at some

706
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,520
 level and it's interesting because, you know, historically we tended to be like, oh, look

707
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,080
 at the chupacabra which is this like goat sucking alien in Puerto Rico which is where

708
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,840
 I'm from and I'm like, I love the chupacabra and it's really about colonialism and post

709
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,640
 colonialism and extraction and I will say that as much as I hate the far right and the

710
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,240
 right, I do actually think that part of the problem, again, I go back to like the liberal

711
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,680
 media and these sorts of things is that, you know, they haven't been historically aggressive

712
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,540
 enough going after the powerful, right?

713
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,320
 And so sometimes you get these conspiracy theories that kind of have like a kernel of

714
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,760
 truth, right?

715
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,720
 And so as you sort of rebuild journalism, you also have to like, you know, I got my

716
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,880
 vaccines and Pfizer helped create it, but Pfizer has done a lot of really fucked up

717
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,020
 things as well, right?

718
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,120
 And so we have to hold these corporations really accountable because I think that helps

719
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,760
 breed conspiracy as well and as kind of Jeremy said, like if you're not doing that, then

720
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,260
 that creates the conditions, but it's going to be a long time.

721
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,920
 Obviously these have come in waves before, so I hope that we overcome the wave before

722
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,240
 we destroy the planet with climate change.

723
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
 That's my big worry now.

724
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,240
 Okay, we have two more minutes.

725
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:28,460
 We have one more question and we need to get that in those two minutes.

726
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,760
 Can we take the two questions side by side and I'll just let...

727
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,960
 So I'll be quick.

728
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,340
 Thanks to both of you for all the great work you've done.

729
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,260
 Thanks for coming and talking to us.

730
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,080
 You said that the postcards from here helped you while you were in prison and I was wondering

731
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,760
 because it was a long time, right?

732
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,760
 And what helped you carry through?

733
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,620
 What else is helpful to do?

734
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,060
 And the second half of the question, now that you're out, are you completely free or are

735
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,540
 you still under some conditions and what is your life like?

736
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,520
 What is your situation?

737
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
 Right, thanks.

738
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
 You're right.

739
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,160
 So prison and jail is an extremely dehumanizing and isolating place.

740
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
 They're trying to break you.

741
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
 They're trying to break your spirits.

742
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,160
 But one thing I've learned is that they can take your body, but they can't take your mind.

743
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
 It's that last inch.

744
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
 You're free.

745
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:24,560
 And so being an isolating place, it's a whole world of fences and walls trying to separate.

746
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,720
 It is a whole micro nation where they're basically second classes and stuff.

747
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,880
 So I do a lot of political prisoner work and books to prisoners and support now is one

748
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
 of my main things.

749
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,320
 And what we're trying to do is we're trying to pierce that wall.

750
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,480
 We're trying to climb that wall and reach out and make connections with folks to let

751
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,800
 them know that they're not alone.

752
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,580
 It's a very despairing place.

753
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,340
 And so just knowing that you're heard, for one, and just knowing that you got people out

754
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,040
 there that got your back means everything.

755
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,400
 And so what I do, like you said, what conditions and stuff.

756
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,120
 When I got out, I had three years paper and I was on this internet monitoring program

757
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,720
 where it's like a private company that I had to actually pay for all my devices that monitored

758
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,440
 my messages and stuff like that.

759
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,080
 And actually to upload my messages every day and my PO would be like, "Who is this you're

760
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
 talking to?"

761
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
 It was terrible.

762
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,200
 So that's why I've been out two years though.

763
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,440
 And fortunately I had some lawyers who all the way supported me.

764
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,000
 Shout out to Legal Aid, shout out to National Lawyers Guild, by the way.

765
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,840
 And I'm sure you all have the equivalence because they've always had my back and often for free.

766
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,840
 So in my case they actually fought the conditions on free speech and associate.

767
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,720
 They said I couldn't even associate with hackers, couldn't even associate with civil disobedience.

768
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,200
 What the hell that means, right?

769
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,000
 And it was like that the first time too as a matter of fact.

770
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
 I still did what I did though.

771
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,880
 But fortunately my lawyers did beat that with motions after we got the judges transferred

772
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
 over to Chicago and stuff like that.

773
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,200
 One thing I'll say though is that I did two federal sentences for hacking and got arrested

774
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
 dozens of times.

775
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
 I don't regret any of it.

776
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,080
 My only regret is that I didn't give a chance to finish any of the targets I was working

777
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
 on.

778
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,200
 So, can you do the reading quick?

779
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,080
 Because then I would take this as the last quick answer, quick question.

780
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,240
 So if we're talking about hacking and leaking now, I'm wondering what you guys, obviously

781
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,800
 not ideologically, but what you think about ransomware groups and if you think that journalists

782
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,960
 or academics will touch the data that ransomware groups are leaking because they're pushing

783
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,680
 out gigabytes and gigabytes of data from big companies, what do you think about that as

784
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
 a phenomenon?

785
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,400
 Yeah, it's interesting because I feel like I haven't monitored them as closely, but they

786
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,040
 certainly have changed their tactics where they're pulling back a little bit against

787
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,880
 like hospitals and then going against targets where they might hit a law firm that worked

788
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,200
 for Trump, take the emails and then DDoS secrets host them.

789
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,720
 And I actually really respect what DDoS secrets is doing, which takes a kind of equal opportunity

790
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,520
 hosting the stuff.

791
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,800
 They make some stuff public, some stuff they just give to researchers because that stuff

792
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,160
 is really, really important.

793
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,080
 And there still isn't quite enough people going through this material.

794
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,160
 And I also do suspect that ransomware groups are probably strategizing a little bit in

795
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,920
 terms of choosing targets that will help them monetarily, but maybe drawing a little bit

796
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,760
 of public sympathy as well.

797
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,560
 But there is material out there, right?

798
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:19,080
 And I think having the public journalists, others really go through that stuff can yield

799
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,800
 some really, really important insights.

800
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,560
 And that is something that many of us are well positioned to do today.

801
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,400
 I just want real quick, I just want to say that I don't think we should necessarily knock

802
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
 criminal hacking or hacking for survival.

803
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,720
 Those who as a means must learn how to scam copycars or credit card fraud just because

804
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,320
 if people are going to do what they have to do to survive.

805
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,160
 When I was in jail and stuff, I didn't think myself no better or no less than anybody else

806
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
 that was in there.

807
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,280
 And frankly, the second time when I got out, I made a decision to go hard as possible I

808
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,640
 could and go after governments and all this stuff.

809
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
 It was like all gas, right?

810
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
 But I still got 10.

811
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,920
 In the United States, that's actually relatively medium to low.

812
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,920
 So there were 10s and 20s and 30s in life for people just wrong place, wrong time, they

813
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,080
 have to just survive and stuff like that.

814
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,600
 So I'm a little bit humbled and not so like judgment about criminal hacking, which I think

815
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,960
 is still within our rubric.

816
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,880
 So do what you got to do.

817
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:23,360
 Okay, then thank the two of you for coming over here and actually giving the talk.

818
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,240
 And ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy Annette, Biala Coleman.

819
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:49,360
 Thank you.
