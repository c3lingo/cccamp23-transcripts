 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,800
 And okay, we are ready to start.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,720
 So from the US, we have two first time campers that are going to present

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,960
 awesome stuff to us, Matt and Adam.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,480
 They are going to talk us about product review and the malware and

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,920
 the back doors that they have been able to find in those situations.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
 So please give a huge applause to our speakers, please.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,240
 >> [APPLAUSE]

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,800
 >> Hello, thank you.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,480
 I'm Adam Shaw and this is Matt and this is our time in a product review cabal and

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,160
 the malware and bugs that came with it.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,480
 A little bit about us, I lead a team of AppSec engineers.

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,400
 I'm a home lab enthusiast.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,960
 I have my own conference that I help run in Omaha, Nebraska in the United States.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,760
 And I help run my local Defcon group.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,360
 And also I help with a conference in Hawaii called LocomocoSec.

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,440
 Highly recommended if you're able to get out there for that one.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,320
 >> And hey everyone, my name is Matt Veras.

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,160
 It is my real last name.

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,920
 I'm a IoT engineer at Cisco for about 15 years now.

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,360
 I'm a part time farmer.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
 I'm a big hardware junkie.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,400
 I take everything apart and find out how it works.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,640
 I'm a former DOD forensic malware reverse engineer analyst.

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,880
 And I'm founder of hackspace.io.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,160
 Slides and stuff from previous projects are posted out there.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,320
 So go check it out and follow us both on Twitter or on Slack or wherever.

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
 >> Awesome.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,160
 And just a quick disclaimer.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,640
 All of this work was done for research purposes only.

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,800
 Nothing we discussed today is representative of our employers.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,560
 We ensured that every review, photo and video were immediately taken down and reported.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,640
 This is platform agnostic.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,560
 It affects all online retailers, not specific ones.

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,040
 And we're an ethical cabal.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,200
 So in July we were accepted for this talk.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,300
 Big thank you to Millie Ways and the staff that put this on.

39
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,920
 This is one of my favorite childhood books.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,920
 So I was super pumped about it.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
 And then in August we decided we had to make the slides.

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,100
 So if you saw us, you know, by our tent, we were working on this for quite some time.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,440
 This is my wife and I, this is like our normal interaction when we have a talk coming up.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,240
 I've almost started.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,720
 So in 2020, there was obviously the global pandemic with COVID.

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,960
 And it meant that everyone needed to wear masks.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
 It was known for three things, right?

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,360
 One, video streaming, all those streaming services.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,440
 And online shopping.

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
 Yeah.

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,000
 So what kind of stuff did you order online?

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,600
 Maybe groceries, maybe delivery for food or things like that.

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 But not us.

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,680
 We ordered all kinds of electronic gizmos and stuff that we really didn't need but looked

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
 cool and was cheap because we were all stuck at home doing whatever we could only do at

56
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
 home.

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,440
 So that's kind of where we were.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
 So this whole thing started with a postcard.

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
 I had ordered a smart switch from a company called Treat Life.

60
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 And in the box there was this postcard saying, "We are celebrating our company anniversary.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,280
 And you write to us, send us a note and we'll send you a free gift."

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
 And who doesn't like a free gift?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,720
 So I reached out to them.

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 You could see the note there.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,280
 I said, "Hello, Treat Life team.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
 I like free stuff.

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
 How does this work?"

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,000
 And they said, "Oh, hello."

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,560
 And you just buy our thing from this retailer and we'll give you a refund for it.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,760
 And you don't even have to leave us a review or anything.

71
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,200
 Please just go buy it and everything will be good."

72
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,800
 So we did.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,480
 So how it would kind of work is you would reach out to this retailer and say, "Hey,

74
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 I received this offer."

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,060
 And then they would say, "Buy it."

76
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,360
 And then we'll refund your money in PayPal or Amazon or whatever gift card you would

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 like.

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,640
 And then you would have the device and use it and there would be no strings with some

79
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,740
 vendors.

80
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,220
 But then as we move forward, we learned that some vendors play by some different rules

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,000
 and they may require a positive five-star review before they'll give you the reimbursement.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
 And it must have pictures or must have this or must have that.

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,000
 But in general, with some of the vendors, they would give it for free for no strings

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
 attached.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
 So once we start collecting things, it got to be quite a lot.

86
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,680
 Cameras, switches, a lot of smart home devices.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,520
 I'm a big smart home automation firmware enthusiast, so that's kind of where I was targeting.

88
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,480
 But then other strange devices too like a vacuum cleaner, which was really interesting.

89
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,140
 And lots of cameras and other things, desk lamps, steaks, kitchen appliances, all kinds

90
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,000
 of things.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,020
 So the list grew.

92
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,400
 And as we collected more things, we started getting emails from additional vendors that

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
 we hadn't necessarily reached out to directly.

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
 It seemed that there was kind of this special list of customers that was shared amongst

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,680
 these companies that were sending things out for free.

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,600
 And so the more that we interacted with them, the more we got.

97
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,820
 And the more vendors came to ask us if we would like their stuff.

98
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,560
 So more is always better.

99
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,260
 And then we started thinking like a hacker or thinking like a larcenist, what if we were

100
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,820
 to use multiple email accounts to interact with them?

101
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,360
 What if I want two of that thing or maybe five of that thing?

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
 How could I do that?

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,080
 So we'll have multiple email accounts and forward messages between them and collect things.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
 And we were wondering at first, like, is this a good idea?

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
 Will they notice?

106
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 They did not.

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,880
 They did not notice at all.

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,400
 And in fact, things kind of escalated on from there.

109
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,520
 So the thing that happened then is as we started collecting things and telling our friends,

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,720
 they were jealous of all of the cool stuff we got.

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,420
 Like I want stuff too.

112
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,280
 So sharing is caring.

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,080
 And we started to share some of our friends' contact information with these vendors.

114
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
 And some of the sharing we did was official.

115
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,560
 It was hello, Mr. Vendor, I have a friend who would like to work with you and the vendors

116
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
 would always say yes.

117
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,760
 But then as we'll talk about in a slide or two, some of the referrals were maybe not

118
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,500
 quite so official.

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,600
 So we'll talk about that in just a moment.

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
 >> Yeah.

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 And along the way, we realized that there's just a bunch of people out there sending these

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,200
 messages and they don't really care what we respond with.

123
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,720
 They don't really care who we are.

124
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,320
 They don't really care where we're sending the items.

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,360
 I was sending items to like family members at some points.

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 And then I realized that they didn't care.

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,120
 So I started sending them to different apartments in my own house.

128
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,240
 I had six or seven apartments in my house that I would send them to.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,640
 And they just all show up on my doorstep.

130
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:08,320
 And we realized, okay, let's just share the -- not only are we sharing like -- not only

131
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,160
 are we telling the vendors, hey, contact this person, but now if they contact us, let's

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,080
 just send that email to another one of our friends.

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,420
 And then more friends can sign up.

134
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,880
 And then more friends.

135
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,000
 We eventually just dropped all the pretense altogether.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,120
 And we started by sending -- we would change the headers and modify the email and make

137
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,960
 it look like they had emailed us.

138
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,280
 But at the end of it, I was just replying to ones that were sent to Matt, for example.

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,680
 >> Like, hey, Adam, I got an invite for a pool filter and some kitchen knives.

140
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 Would you like that one?

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,120
 >> And I say, I need some knives.

142
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
 Sure.

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,280
 And I would just reply to the email address and say, please send me knives.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,860
 And they'd say, okay.

145
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,700
 And so they'd just send stuff then.

146
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,320
 And we started sharing the best invites.

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,920
 And this is how we built this cabal of people who we would just share all the invites with.

148
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,460
 And we'd say, hey, I got an invite group or chat.

149
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:15,380
 And this invite is product X, Y, and Z. And somebody would say, I need product Y.

150
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,580
 And so we just forward the email to them.

151
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,360
 And somebody else would say, I need product X and forward the email to them.

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,880
 And nobody ever seemed to notice.

153
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,000
 And we just, everyone just got free stuff.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
 The profit slide where Matt had all of those different things, every one of us had closets

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,400
 like that, you know, where we were just filling up with stuff.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,140
 The problem is, they started turning into pushers.

157
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,260
 They started sending us emails and they'd say, hey, here is 60 products.

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,340
 Pick two of them that you want.

159
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,060
 And they would be the most wacky products.

160
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
 Sex toys.

161
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
 Dog treat dispensers.

162
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
 Pool floaties.

163
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
 Yeah.

164
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,060
 Toilet scooters.

165
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,060
 Toilet drain stoppers.

166
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
 Yeah.

167
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
 Pasta dishes.

168
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,940
 And we didn't really care about a lot of those.

169
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,500
 What we cared about was the technology ones that we were interested in and researching.

170
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,040
 But it got extensive.

171
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,780
 And there was a few main characters in this.

172
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:25,860
 If you see these on your recommended anywhere, know that 90% of their reviews are probably

173
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,420
 fake.

174
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,260
 One of them is Vixer.

175
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,100
 See all the different emails.

176
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,940
 It's a little difficult to see in the sunlight over here, but all the different emails on

177
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,940
 the right from Vixer over 2020.

178
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,180
 Apeman was a big one.

179
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,540
 They would send us emails constantly and Treat Life.

180
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,980
 Treat Life was one of our favorites.

181
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,220
 By far the favorite.

182
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220
 Yeah.

183
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,220
 Because highly recommended.

184
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,300
 Well, they send good quality products that are mostly not...

185
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,540
 Well, we'll get into the technical details in a minute.

186
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,980
 But they also never really cared if you did the reviews or not.

187
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,300
 We would go and make a review.

188
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,980
 And for some products that you had to have a review before they reimbursed you, and then

189
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,620
 we would immediately delete the review and report it.

190
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:28,660
 Or other products, like Treat Life, I could just open up my developer console in Chrome

191
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,620
 and just edit one to look like I just made a review and screenshot it and send it.

192
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
 And they didn't even look.

193
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
 They were just like, "All right, here's money.

194
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
 Here you go."

195
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,060
 Yeah, or even they would just say, "Please send us your order ID."

196
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,020
 And after they got the order ID, they would just pay right away.

197
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
 Yeah.

198
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,860
 And then Facebook groups.

199
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,700
 We were involved in a lot of these.

200
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,300
 In fact, after the pandemic, we pretty much stopped doing this.

201
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,380
 It was a while back, but we still get invites all the time.

202
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,780
 And they're primarily moving to Facebook now, I've noticed.

203
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,420
 I get a lot of Facebook invites, and they email to me to join their Facebook group.

204
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,100
 And they're actually moving countries now, too.

205
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:20,420
 While I was preparing slides, one of the emails I got for a Facebook group was specific to

206
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,700
 Thailand.

207
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:29,140
 So only in Thailand do they want people to come and do reviews, which I thought was interesting.

208
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,580
 But what about the stuff?

209
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,140
 We're giving all this free stuff, but what about it?

210
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,500
 And for that, let's dive deep.

211
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 Yeah.

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,220
 So this is by no means exhaustive or complete.

213
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,780
 This is just a few of the particularly interesting details from a deep dive of what the hardware

214
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,560
 and software looked like.

215
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,860
 So I encourage you to do your own research and follow along if you'd like.

216
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,060
 So the first case study we'll talk about is the three T's.

217
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,940
 Treat Life, Tekken, and Tuya.

218
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,580
 So Treat Life and Tekken use the Tuya IoT platform.

219
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,220
 Maybe some of you have heard of the Tuya platform.

220
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,820
 It's one of the largest in the world.

221
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
 And anybody can sign up to use Tuya.

222
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,220
 You just pay them a few dollars, and you can use their development kit, and you can even

223
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,900
 use their hardware that they kind of white label, and then you can cook your own firmware

224
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,740
 for it, and it's very interesting.

225
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,260
 So interesting things about Tuya is they store a number of things in plain text.

226
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,140
 They collect a number of things plain text.

227
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,420
 Phone number, the device that you use to set it up, the SSID that it connects to, the device

228
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,780
 stats like when a light switch turns on or off, things like that.

229
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,340
 But where things get really interesting and particularly dangerous that maybe people haven't

230
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,580
 thought of is a number of the vacuum cleaners, including the one that I got through this

231
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
 program.

232
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,880
 They're using the Tuya platform.

233
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,540
 So the floor plans of your house are potentially in the Tuya cloud, and whatever vendor sold

234
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,500
 that to you can access that and sell that to anyone or do whatever they'd like with

235
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 it.

236
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
 So that's interesting.

237
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,660
 And of course the device manufacturer, whoever that is, they can push a firmware update whenever

238
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,580
 they want, and they can do it silently.

239
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,500
 So if you -- I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but if you go look at Michael Stegerwald's

240
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,860
 talk from a few years ago at a CCC event, he talks extensively about the evils of Tuya

241
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,500
 and how they can do all sorts of interesting things.

242
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,900
 I'd encourage you to go take a look at that.

243
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:30,380
 So the first wave of devices that were collected from TreatLife and from Tekken were ESP8266-based,

244
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,440
 and it's a great microprocessor.

245
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,460
 It's fantastic for the hacker community.

246
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,580
 The Wemos D1 minis for sale over in the village, that's an ESP8266.

247
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,300
 They're easy to flash, Arduino compatible, very good firmware.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,780
 And what happened eventually is we were flashing devices just with an interface with the FTDI.

249
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,340
 And then there was this massive vulnerability that Stegerwald came out with from VTrust

250
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,140
 where we were able to flash device firmware over the air without having to take it apart

251
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,580
 or solder or anything, and it was great.

252
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,460
 It's called TuyaConvert, and the link's right there.

253
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,500
 You can check it out.

254
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,260
 And TuyaConvert worked for quite a while.

255
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,060
 There were several kind of cat and mouse games where the firmware got patched and then the

256
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,300
 exploit got rewritten, and eventually it stopped working.

257
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,380
 They changed the way that the keys were derived for the devices, and no longer could we just

258
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,300
 flash them over the air because of the private key and public key interaction between the

259
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,900
 server and the device.

260
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,760
 So then things were great.

261
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,180
 We were collecting all these devices and taking all of this terrible Tuya code off

262
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,220
 and putting firmware like Tesmota or ESPHome running it with Node-RED.

263
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,260
 But then the devices themselves changed.

264
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,460
 The ESP8266 disappeared.

265
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:50,620
 And despite this very substantial change in the device, the FCC documentation never changed.

266
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,900
 And that's kind of an interesting question for devices that the FCC reviews.

267
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,660
 If there's a substantial change, it's supposed to require a follow-on examination.

268
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,980
 I would say that changing the microcontroller would be substantial enough to require a new

269
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,180
 examination.

270
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,500
 So it became very hard to know which device would have which controller or which CU.

271
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,760
 So we kind of got to where you try to order from maybe different vendors and try to find

272
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,980
 one that had old stock because at the time we didn't really know what to do with these

273
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,900
 processors and we didn't want to just put them on our network and deal with the evilness

274
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,300
 of Tuya.

275
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,460
 But the interesting thing about these controllers is they were the same pinout as the ESP, but

276
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,020
 they were not able to run Arduino code, so it was good and bad.

277
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,620
 Then we figured out that they're pin compatible with the ESP32C3 and the ESP12F, so we'd use

278
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,420
 a hot air station and just drop the chip off and then put a chip flash with Tesmota or

279
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,860
 potentially ESPHome, but usually Tesmota, so you could step through the GPIOs and figure

280
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,260
 out the hardware traces and do that easily.

281
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,100
 So then everything was very good again.

282
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,580
 We could take these devices with terrible processors and use them with our open source

283
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
 code.

284
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,380
 Very good.

285
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,380
 But then moving forward, Khalid Nassar and some others, there's an excellent post here.

286
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,780
 You should definitely go read it.

287
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,220
 He walks through a very detailed posting of how some data was stored in some fields inappropriately

288
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,220
 and there was no bounce checking on it, so we were able to inject code into that buffer.

289
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,500
 And through that we're able to run a vulnerability that's been called named Tuya Cloud Cutter.

290
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,700
 And with Cloud Cutter, originally we were able to modify the local keys on the device,

291
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,100
 and when we modify the local keys, we could potentially write the same key to all of the

292
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,820
 devices that we're working with.

293
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,520
 So we have a common key to access our devices, and once we modify the keys, then Tuya can

294
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,020
 no longer interact with the device, so we still have untrusted firmware, but we have

295
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,260
 a device that we can control that no one else can control, so it's generally good.

296
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,260
 And there are ways to hook that device with different automation platforms and make it

297
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,100
 work, so that was good.

298
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,620
 But then as we moved forward, there was some substantial development done with a project

299
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,500
 called, it was originally called Libretuya, but Tuya got mad at that, so it became renamed

300
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,780
 Libretiny.

301
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,820
 And another one called OpenBeckon.

302
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,980
 Libretiny is a port of ESPHome that runs on the Becken hardware, and it looks a lot like

303
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,220
 ESPHome works the same as YAML-based.

304
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,820
 There's a container plugin for Home Assistant, it all works very well.

305
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,100
 And OpenBeckon is a standalone hardware.

306
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,060
 It's kind of sort of similar to Tasmota, if any of you have used it, but it gives you

307
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,860
 an API and MQTT and everything, and it runs standalone on the device.

308
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,940
 Fairly stable, revved a lot, the developer is active in a lot of discords, and as is

309
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,340
 the developer for Libretiny, very active.

310
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,460
 So in the end, we have hardware that was previously untrusted that we couldn't work with, that

311
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,060
 was linked to a generally evil overlay platform, but now we're able to put whatever firmware

312
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,620
 we want on it, control it how we want, and we're able to audit all of the functions that

313
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
 firmware does.

314
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,340
 So very powerful, and we take a device that we can't trust at all to a device that we

315
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,860
 absolutely trust, and we can do whatever we'd like with it.

316
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,420
 The next case study is around cameras, and there are many cameras that were collected.

317
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,180
 I use these, I live on a farm, so I use some of these cameras in the shop and for outdoor

318
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,740
 surveillance and kind of all over the place, so many cameras.

319
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:28,700
 And the default in stock firmware was very much not good, very unstable, and very interesting

320
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,180
 connections outbound.

321
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:37,340
 Some of the cameras were using the Tuya platform, and interesting, some of them were leaking

322
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:44,820
 to Chinese IP space in earlier firmwares, and there was one, I forgot to collect the

323
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,020
 data and save it, but in advance of a firmware update, before it was beaconing out to some

324
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,340
 Chinese IP space, and then after a firmware update it was leaking out to a cloud provider

325
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:02,020
 that was US IP space, but it's important to know that the country destination of the,

326
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,380
 the country of the destination IP is really not all that important, and in the end there's

327
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,500
 nothing that stops a foreign national from creating a cloud provider account and collecting

328
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,960
 data and packing it off wherever they'd like.

329
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,420
 So whether that's a US cloud provider or a Chinese cloud provider, it still should be

330
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,260
 handled with a minimal amount of trust.

331
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,460
 So the, in particular the cameras that were not on the Tuya platform, there's one from

332
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,260
 S-Cam that was very interesting, it has this P2P connectivity and there's a QR code that

333
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,940
 has a device ID, and this device ID, if you have it, you can connect to the camera with

334
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,940
 no authentication, all you need is that device ID, so it's very dangerous.

335
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,740
 And a gentleman named Paul, he gave a big talk on the dangers of this particular P2P

336
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,860
 network at Defcon, I think two years ago, but the link is there, definitely go watch

337
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,540
 it, there's huge exposure, and the goal of the P2P network is to make it so you don't

338
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,780
 have to port forward, or so you can use these cameras behind a CG NAT and still have access

339
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,420
 to the video, but the thing about that is it gives whoever's authoring the firmware

340
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,100
 and pushing the updates the ability to do reverse shells and all those things as well, so it's

341
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,040
 a terrible security vulnerability and just something that's very dangerous that you should

342
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,440
 not ever trust on your network.

343
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,060
 So with this particular camera, there's an app to set it up called the P6S Lite, and

344
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,620
 some of the early documentation of the app references local mode, where you could open

345
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,000
 the app on your phone and it would find the camera and peer to it and then you could do

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,820
 local mode and it would pull up an interface where you could tell the camera to connect,

347
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:47,020
 and so this particular app was missing that function, and so that was troubling, it was

348
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,600
 kind of what happened to this interface.

349
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,300
 So it started trolling around on an Android phone and was able to connect to the SSID

350
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,020
 broadcast by the camera and then exited the app, dropped into the network settings and

351
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,580
 saw that it was a very non-standard, very strange DHCP IP that I'd been assigned, but with a

352
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:12,060
 very common gateway, a .1 gateway, so opened a browser window to .1 on my phone and here

353
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,440
 I have the interface to this camera, and once I have access to the camera's web interface,

354
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,000
 I was able to configure it to SSID and configure it to join my network and I was able to not

355
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,900
 allow it to register on the P2P network, so interesting functionality that was there in

356
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:34,180
 like the 2.x version of the app that was gone in the 3.x and they're now on 5 or late 5s

357
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,900
 or early 6s, so it's like that function was purposefully taken out, at least that would

358
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:47,080
 be my conjecture, so an interesting removal from that APK.

359
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,860
 So I kind of got ahead of myself a bit, but yeah, the local mode was gone and when you

360
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:58,540
 do this via direct web interface, the P2P registration does not happen and as you see in this one,

361
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,900
 this is an iteration I did while using the actual app and doing it and this camera actually

362
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,260
 did join that P2P network and all sorts of interestingness, so every camera, whether

363
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,420
 it was Tuya or non-Tuya platform, every camera beaconed out, some a little bit, some a whole

364
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,100
 lot, some of the interesting addresses were some of them were China and some other ones

365
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,500
 were China and some of that's Alibaba, some of it's not and some of the other IP connections

366
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,820
 were previously, like I said, to China and then some to other non-Chinese cloud providers

367
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,580
 but still not to be trusted.

368
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,460
 The cameras worked to a varying degree of success, some not at all and some really well

369
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,380
 with RTSP and ONVIF, those are ways to access a camera locally and have the data local and

370
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,340
 not out to a cloud or a cloud server, some of them worked, some of them did not at all

371
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,980
 and the typical ways with the non-trusted firmware that you can take a camera like that that

372
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:58,860
 does allow ONVIF or RTSP to allow and have it be semi-trusted is create a P2P reservation

373
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,260
 for it with no default gateway and/or give it no DNS, have layer 3 ACLs, even layer 2

374
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,460
 ACLs if you'd like, there are a number of ways to take a device like that and pin it

375
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,980
 in a corner but still have it be usable, not necessarily the recommended way.

376
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,940
 Most of the cameras were using Acya and Realtek chipsets, if you troll around a bit you can

377
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,300
 find that the UART and JTAG interfaces for these chipsets are generally documented, I

378
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,620
 wouldn't say well documented but I would say that they are documented and there are OpenIPC

379
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,740
 for sure works on the S-cam, I set that up and it works fairly well, there's a lot of

380
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,740
 the Realtek firmware support for the Yi cameras and some of the Victor cameras and some of

381
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,620
 the others, so with some digging you can get this set up and working and you can get these

382
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,060
 cameras to run code that you can actually audit and you know what it does because you've

383
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,660
 seen the code and you can follow the packets so that would be my suggestion if you're going

384
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,820
 to chase after any of these devices is do a bit of research, pull down my slides, find

385
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,920
 some of the devices that use these particular chipsets that you can push your firmware to

386
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,940
 and not have to deal with some third party vendors firmware and be at their mercy.

387
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:19,700
 Yeah, unsurprisingly cameras were probably the most emailed thing that we got, you know

388
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:27,180
 obviously vendors wanted you know wanted insight into our homes, baby monitors were up there

389
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:34,240
 too, I actually had small kids during the pandemic and had used some of these products

390
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,240
 as baby monitors so obviously they had to be safe.

391
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,320
 The other big one was some type of routers, there was mesh routers and Wi-Fi extenders

392
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,080
 that they were always offering and I think that's pretty obvious too why that was another

393
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,100
 one that got offered a lot.

394
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:02,740
 In this case study this is a mesh force router, the router configuration required a phone

395
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,300
 to set up, they don't have a web interface for the router and Nmap showed three open

396
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:16,860
 ports 5500 which is UPMP, obviously that should be disabled by default to protect security

397
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,200
 and it wasn't.

398
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,380
 Port 9000 for the app interface and ports 12598 used for auto configuring the Wi-Fi

399
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,020
 repeaters.

400
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,680
 Originally the app used clear text TCP coms over port 9000 to retrieve the serial number

401
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,660
 and configure the device, the serial number then became an unchangeable password and you

402
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,460
 weren't able to do anything about that.

403
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:54,420
 This is again this is the mesh force router which is still on sale today on online retailers.

404
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:00,560
 Also then the Android reached out to a few places, one the router, fine, for some reason

405
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:07,920
 it tried to call out to Facebook, I don't know why and then lastly another IP, I wonder

406
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,620
 what that is, it's China.

407
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:18,660
 So this is another case where we were looking at a device that basically was calling out

408
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:30,940
 to places to give them access or some type of data and what else went wrong with it?

409
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,500
 We had an APK of the app, the Android app, so APKs obviously we can expand and dwell

410
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:46,220
 into them and when you do that and look at the Java classes with something like JD GUI,

411
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:54,300
 we saw references to CGI bin Lucy admin data manager which if you Google it and do some

412
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:02,980
 research, this is a possible tender back door which has been everywhere.

413
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:11,220
 Here's a couple of articles referencing a tender back door in wireless routers and this

414
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:19,100
 is something that is very similar and that's as deep as we went right there because that

415
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,420
 was enough for me to junk it to be honest and we have a giveaway and we're giving it

416
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:35,340
 away but honestly this was a really fun time because we were stuck at home and we had a

417
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,460
 lot of time on our hands and so we were able to pour all of our time into looking into

418
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,580
 these products to determine what's safe and what wasn't.

419
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:52,980
 Some lessons that we learned, if something is too good to be true, it probably is, right?

420
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,740
 Always check your hardware that you're buying offline in a safe environment before plugging

421
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:04,540
 it into like a production home operations and be wary of online reviews.

422
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,780
 Research with caution, not all of them are legitimate.

423
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,180
 So how do you spot fake reviews?

424
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:19,780
 Again, all of Matt's and I reviews were then immediately deleted and nuked from the platform

425
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:28,380
 but here's how you can spot fake reviews if you're online and if you're looking at buying

426
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
 a product.

427
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,740
 One, is this a brand you trust?

428
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:39,820
 Does it have a trusted name in the industry or is it something you've never heard of before?

429
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:46,660
 Some of these vendors would send us emails with different names, different product names,

430
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:53,140
 so they were constantly recreating companies and putting a new decal on their product and

431
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,420
 that was a brand new company for them.

432
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,940
 So they were switching company names all the time.

433
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,860
 If you can check user history, do it.

434
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:08,900
 Not all platforms allow you to view reviews that a user has left but some platforms do.

435
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,780
 Some of these online retailers allow you to view other things that this person has reviewed.

436
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
 Check that out if you can.

437
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,020
 If you see a lot of, well, a lot of reviews frankly on particular products, that could

438
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,140
 be a red flag.

439
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,060
 So all of these reviews, the ones that required us to leave a review before a refund, they

440
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,980
 also required that you left a picture.

441
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,620
 So I'm not saying that pictured reviews are necessarily more fake but that's something

442
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,220
 that was like, bare minimum, you had to add it.

443
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
 Yeah, sure.

444
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,020
 And one other thing is the reviews all had to be five stars.

445
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,820
 Could be four, had to be five.

446
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,580
 So be very wary and when we would leave these reviews, we wanted to get our money but we

447
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,300
 would still write a review that would maybe say, "Hey, here's three good things and two

448
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,820
 really bad things but I still give it five stars because the good things were so good."

449
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,740
 So if you see reviews that are like, "This product was great except for this was really

450
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,180
 terrible but I give it five stars."

451
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,540
 That was written to get a reimbursement for sure.

452
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,420
 I had some egregious ones where I'd say, "Here's one good thing and here's six bad things about

453
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:24,420
 this product and they still send me the money but I was trying to warn people from getting

454
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,820
 that particular product."

455
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,340
 And then the other thing, the time the review has been posted.

456
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,540
 So this is an industry, right?

457
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
 This is a business.

458
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,420
 You can go purchase fake reviews online and there are companies out there who will go

459
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,380
 and they'll find email lists like our names are on these email lists and they'll just

460
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:49,660
 spam them and try to get people to do reviews and if the reviews have been posted within

461
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,300
 a few days, it might be fake because usually companies nowadays, online retailers, they've

462
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:03,900
 used reports like Matt and I have been doing and others to actually get pretty good at

463
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,260
 detecting fake reviews and they'll ban accounts too.

464
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,000
 They'll ban an account if they see enough fake reviews but usually that's a one or two

465
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,420
 day process before they can determine, "Hey, is this review legitimate or fake?"

466
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,740
 And so if you have a review that's less than two days old, good chances are that you want

467
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,860
 to maybe circle back in a few days and see if it's still there.

468
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,060
 Now this isn't all doom and gloom.

469
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,460
 There are good companies that do these kind of things.

470
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,780
 A good example is Amcrest.

471
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,700
 Amcrest has actually reached out to people like Matt and I and they've offered a research

472
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,020
 fee for purchasing their camera and reviewing.

473
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,140
 They never asked for an online review.

474
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,100
 They only asked for us to review and send them our feedback, right?

475
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:05,380
 And this is an example of a 4K camera that they sent us and the product cost $80 but

476
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,500
 the research fee was $140, which is another good way to do it.

477
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,700
 Not only that but we were still able to pass the emails around the cabal and so we all

478
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,260
 have Amcrest cameras now, which is great.

479
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,440
 The feedback we gave them we think is valuable too.

480
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,860
 One of the things that we -- this is a little difficult to see here but hopefully the stream

481
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,540
 can see it in the videos later.

482
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:39,380
 But there's a red -- there's a red lens on this camera and a red lighting area for the

483
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,600
 infrared at nighttime.

484
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
 The product doesn't actually have it.

485
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 But the picture has it.

486
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,780
 So, like, that's something that we were able to call out.

487
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,500
 When you open the box up, it actually looks a lot cleaner than the picture that they're

488
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,660
 using for the product does.

489
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,260
 So we were able to call it out, give them feedback, and that's a good symbiotic relationship,

490
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
 right?

491
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,740
 Where we're able to give them good and honest feedback but we don't have to then go and

492
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:12,580
 leave them a five-star review and inflate their online reviews.

493
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,860
 That said, I'd be happy to give this a five-star review.

494
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,780
 It was a good product.

 KU.NZ, this is a blog.

497
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,460
 This gentleman actually researched the mesh router before I did.

498
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,020
 And so a lot of the same things that he found, we found.

499
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,580
 But that's a good one.

500
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,580
 Also all the icons that we got are from the noun project and the flat icon.

501
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,740
 It's all, you know, sourced, free icons.

505
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,500
 >> So, yeah.

506
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,380
 Thank you a lot for a great talk.

 So please line up.

509

 If you're like want to make the questions from the Internet, the obvious channels from

510
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,700
 Fediverse and Matrix are taking questions as well.

511
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
 >> Yeah.

512
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,740
 Can you guys tell me what's the most expensive item you got?

513
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,020
 >> So there were two things that I got that were kind of noteworthy.

514
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,220
 I got a robot vacuum that was around $200.

515
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,900
 And still works pretty well.

516
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
 Don't trust it at all.

517
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,460
 But it works well.

518
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
 It's in my shop.

519
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,020
 It cleans the floor out there.

520
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,980
 And then the other thing that was a little more like $250 US dollars is a DVR system.

521
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,420
 It had the central DVR.

522
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,460
 Had to put your own hard drive in it.

523
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,740
 But then it had five cameras.

524
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,420
 And the cameras, it was all on between the cameras and the DVR.

525
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
 And it worked really well.

526
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:06,820
 But the review that was submitted for that product actually got flagged as fake and got

527
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,780
 deleted.

528
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,100
 In the lag time between when I reached out to the vendor to request the refund, they

529
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,340
 said oh, your review that you sent the screen shot of does not exist.

530
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,980
 And I was like, ugh, it is what it is.

531
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
 So I had to send that back.

532
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:27,220
 But yeah, the vacuum was $200 and the DVR system was around $250.

533
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,420
 >> The most expensive thing that I got was actually probably that mesh router which was

534
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,260
 around $200 as well.

535
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,780
 There was a clear cap on at least when I was going through it on the dollar amount that

536
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,740
 they would go which was usually $250.

537
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:53,580
 If it got above $200, they were very demanding on the type of review and the type of account

538
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,020
 that you had to have in order to post the review.

539
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,560
 A lot of these people required that you have an account with that online retailer for over

540
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,860
 two years before you could post a review on something that was expensive.

541
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,440
 >> And on the expensive things, like one other thing that we didn't mention is they would

542
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,540
 have these stipulations like you must have a long standing account, you must have this.

543
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,340
 But then they would try to sweeten the deal a little bit.

544
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:24,300
 They would say and we'll refund plus a 10% commission.

545
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,160
 A 10% uplift for your trouble.

546
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,880
 And then sometimes you would tell a vendor, no, that's a lot of work and I can't do that.

547
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,440
 They would say, well, what if we paid you half up front and then you post the review

548
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,660
 and we pay you the other half.

549
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,840
 So they would get really aggressive and try to get you to buy the higher dollar products.

550
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,320
 >> I got a projector that was about $200 too.

551
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,280
 And they're sweetening the deal.

552
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,960
 Was a projection screen which I thought was really good.

553
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,720
 I was like, oh, yeah, that sounds great.

554
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,000
 So they sent me a big sheet of paper.

555
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 >> Okay.

556
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,280
 We've got to have the next question from there as well.

557
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,920
 >> Thanks for the talk, guys.

558
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,720
 My first question is what do you think the main motivation for this type of behavior

559
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
 is?

560
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,280
 Is it profiteering, e-crime, state sponsored, or is it a mix of them all?

561
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
 >> Yeah.

562
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,680
 So I think that there, even within what we did, there were multiple motives.

563
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,120
 I think that like TreatLife was trying to be the number one company.

564
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,280
 If you would go on online retailers and search for smart home, smart switch, smart dimmer,

565
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,860
 TreatLife wanted to be the number one product.

566
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:38,320
 And the way you get to be the number one search result is by selling the most volume.

567
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,600
 And selling volume to people who will maybe write reviews but more just selling volume,

568
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
 period.

569
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,480
 So I think TreatLife was trying to trend in the searches.

570
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,560
 And I think that maybe other vendors had different motives as far as data collection and marketing

571
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,360
 and selling data.

572
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
 So I think both.

573
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
 >> Yeah.

574
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,440
 I think some of the -- so there's an external company, right?

575
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,120
 There are external companies that actually do -- there's external companies that actually

576
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,620
 mark -- that do this.

577
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,000
 And they'll sell and they'll market and they'll get you reviews, et cetera.

578
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,860
 And what they're -- they're going for profit, right?

579
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:23,960
 But if I'm a bad actor and I want my back doors in as many devices as possible, I hire

580
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,520
 them to then go do that.

581
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,000
 So there's two different kind of motives I see.

582
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 But good question.

583
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Thank you.

584
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 >> Okay.

585
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,840
 We have a next question from the Internet, please.

586
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
 >> Yep.

587
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,840
 The Internet asks, how can someone start or get involved in such a --

588
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,640
 >> The first rule of Fight Club is we don't talk about Fight Club.

589
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
 >> Yeah.

590
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,320
 Good question.

591
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:57,340
 >> There are still products that have those types of postcards in them.

592
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:03,600
 Maybe just try to find some or maybe send me a note on Twitter and I can help you.

593
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,920
 >> The postcards are the entry for us.

594
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,720
 So if you're buying those products, they'll come online.

595
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 Yep.

596
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
 Please go ahead.

597
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,880
 >> I had a quick question about you said you were reporting those products sometimes.

598
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,960
 Was that to the eShops themselves or to some kind of government agency?

599
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,200
 And did you get any reply from any of them?

600
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
 >> The online retailers.

601
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 Yeah.

602
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,320
 The online retailers.

603
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,240
 And then usually we'd have them deleted and report it.

604
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
 And so the replies were nothing or minimal.

605
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
 >> Yeah.

606
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
 Just automated response generally.

607
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
 >> Yeah.

608
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
 Thank you.

609
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
 We will get back to you.

610
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,040
 And then we never hear back.

611
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,120
 Good question, though.

612
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,480
 >> Okay.

613
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,920
 We have still time for a couple of questions if somebody has some.

614
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,440
 If not, please give a huge applause to Adam and Matt.
