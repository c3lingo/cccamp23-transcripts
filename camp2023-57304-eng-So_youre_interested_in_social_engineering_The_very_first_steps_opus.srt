 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,840
 With that, I would like to introduce our next speaker, Kirill.

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,720
 He will be speaking about social engineering.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,920
 So please give a round of applause for Kirill.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,960
 >> [APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,720
 >> Thank you, thank you.

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,880
 Wow, didn't expect this size of crowd.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,640
 Cool t-shirt, by the way.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:57,160
 So my name is Kirill and I think my first KS event was back in 2010.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,840
 So it was a pleasure to be to all of them.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,120
 I run a security company, but I do love social engineering and

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,360
 talking to people and getting things achieved.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,560
 So this presentation is a very beginner kind of presentation, very hands on.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,520
 When I was making the slides,

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 I could not avoid to include some theory at the beginning.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,120
 But what I hope all of you will leave with is some hands on things that you can try

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,240
 right now at the camp and that you can try later in the airport or

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
 in the train when going back home.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
 So yeah, these are things we're gonna talk about.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,200
 You see them in the agenda, imagine.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,920
 Let's go through them.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,160
 So what is social engineering?

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,040
 Social engineering is actually a subfield of offensive cyber security.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,440
 And social engineering itself is a field that includes many different

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,120
 subfields of ways to get your way.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:03,280
 And one thing I wanna focus on real quick, and these are the theory slides.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
 So I'm gonna go through them real quick.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,960
 You're gonna have the slides available today on keros.org if you wish.

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,080
 But one important thing, really one of the cornerstones to keep in mind is that

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,000
 when you social engineer an organization instead of a single individual,

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
 it's always a cycle.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,320
 So you never start with preparation, then build some trust and exploit, and

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
 then you're done.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,280
 It's never linear.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,840
 It's always a cycle, and it's always a cycle because you cannot and

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,920
 should not ask everything from a single employee, from a single contact,

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,680
 everything at once.

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
 You should never do that.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,440
 So the cycle is you do your research, you do your homework without ever talking to

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,960
 anyone, without ever contacting anyone.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,040
 Then you target someone, some individual, then you build trust, and

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,280
 then you exploit that trust relationship for your benefit.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,200
 So this is basically the social engineering attack cycle.

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
 Now once again, real quick, I'm gonna go through this real quick.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
 I could talk about this slide for 20 minutes, I think.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,480
 So the attack types that you have in person, right?

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
 You have impersonation,

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,880
 which is what most social engineering encounters are actually based on.

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,080
 You pretend to be someone else entirely, or you pretend to be maybe

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,960
 a bit higher or a bit otherwise privileged than you actually are.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,600
 You can pretend to be VIP, like a CEO of a company, if it's a large company,

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,760
 a user calling tech support or tech support calling user.

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,160
 Or you can appeal to authority saying, yeah, but the big boss said,

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,880
 even though it's against rules, he'll take full responsibility for that.

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,600
 So it sometimes works.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 Reverse social engineering is also a cool thing, right?

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,640
 You can try to make sure that the person that you are,

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,960
 social engineering, we call them the mark, that they contact you.

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,280
 Because actually one of the hardest things for

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,520
 a professional social engineer to overcome is battle for your time.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,560
 You're there watching a movie, working with a work document, and

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 someone calls you, someone emails you, someone approaches you.

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,880
 The hardest thing is actually to make sure that the person gives enough

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,520
 attention to you, and the easiest way to work with that is reverse social

66
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,800
 engineering.

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
 Breaks their computer, they call you.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,160
 Identity theft, of course, and just stealing someone's photo and

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,640
 name and making fake social profile, fake driver application on the map and so on.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,920
 Now for access, we have tailgating and piggybacking.

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,720
 The first one is without the person's knowledge, right?

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,040
 You try to enter a restricted area.

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
 Piggybacking is with the person's knowledge, right?

74
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,080
 So you have a fake badge, they look at you, they open the door for you.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,360
 Key duplication, maybe it's not a very human attack, but

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,880
 it does have a human factor, so we can talk about that in a bit as well.

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 Acquisition finally.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
 So to acquire some data passively, you can eavesdrop.

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,640
 You can talk about that, you can shoulder surf, and you can dumpster dive,

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,280
 of course, my favorite.

81
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,120
 It's getting harder and harder with all the green stuff going on and

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,520
 trash being divided and segregated, hate segregation.

83
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,920
 But you can actually pay people to do that for you.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,040
 You can teach them how hard drive looks, how flash looks,

85
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,320
 how a document looks, and what you want.

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,120
 Now for remote attack types, we have, of course, many, many,

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,520
 like phishing, spear phishing, targeting someone usually over email.

88
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,160
 Vishing, so voice solicitation over the phone usually.

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,840
 App impersonation, so creating a fake app as well.

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,360
 It also includes an aspect of social nearing and a bunch of others.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,040
 You can look up the methodology online.

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,400
 So delivery vehicles, and it's really important to understand both for

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,800
 offensive perspective and defensive perspective.

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,240
 It can be emails, it can be phone calls, it can be USB drops.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,840
 Sometimes when we have a customer that is really well trained,

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,160
 we print their logo on the USB before we drop it.

97
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,680
 So then, you know, someone lost it.

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
 We'll plug it into the computer and

99
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,440
 they try to find out which colleague lost the USB.

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,640
 Instant messages, of course, SMS, social networks, traffic injection.

101
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,360
 I'm not sure if it got fixed, so I think Google,

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,200
 together with some other browsers, browser manufacturers worked on a standard or

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,200
 something, but like ten years ago, basically, if you have a hotspot in the airport,

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,640
 and you need to click I agree to the rules, that page gets injected and

105
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,120
 you have HTTPS and there's an exception, so you can kind of start injecting

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
 malware or some prompts, enter your PNR, so passenger name record locator,

107
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,560
 enter your surname, and bam, you can cancel someone's flight in the airport.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,200
 Stuff happens.

109
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,920
 Yeah, and of course, malware and adware can also be used for attacks, nothing new.

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,000
 Some years ago, if you were Googling for an anti-malware solution,

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,240
 the top sponsored links were malware, so you can actually inject it that way as well.

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,320
 Okay, that's the theory.

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
 Now let's go to the slow slides.

114
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,280
 So in my opinion, there are just three components to being a social engineer.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,320
 You have to be confident, you have to be quick-witted, and

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
 you have to be determined.

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,920
 So if we take a look at the confidence trick or a con man, right,

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,680
 it's actually shorthand for confidence man, since it's an old term.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,920
 So those are the people that try to trick you into doing stuff.

120
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,200
 Like I was walking along Seine in Paris

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,320
 15, 18 years ago, I was first approached by a con man.

122
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,640
 And basically, there are various tricks they do, right?

123
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,840
 They drop the ring and say, you lost the ring, now it's not yours, okay, but

124
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,040
 you keep it, and then it's good luck, it's real gold, and then you leave.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 And two seconds later, they turn around, I need some money, can you help me?

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,520
 So those kind of comments, right?

127
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
 So it comes from there, and basically all they play on is confidence, and

128
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,280
 it's the same feature, the same thing that we need as a social engineer.

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,000
 So you have to project confidence when you are social engineering someone,

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
 it's super important.

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,960
 The first step to being able to project confidence is convincing yourself first.

132
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,600
 If you're not sure that you're confident enough to do that attack,

133
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,520
 then you cannot, you can, you can do it, but you should not do it.

134
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
 It will likely not work.

135
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,520
 And don't worry, I'll have some other things, some other tips and

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,240
 tricks, some other practical things you can do before actually performing actual

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,040
 attacks so you can build that up.

138
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,520
 For the quick-witted part, you need to be ready to be challenged,

139
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,240
 because someone is gonna challenge you, right?

140
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,400
 It happens all the time.

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,080
 Basically, you can either be really, really on your toes and

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,760
 be ready to answer anything, right?

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
 I'll have some examples later on in the practical section.

144
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,600
 Or you can try to substitute it with a lot of preparation, and

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
 I really mean a lot.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,440
 So you have to build a mind map of all the possible questions you're gonna get asked,

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,400
 and then you don't need that.

148
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
 But it's not practical, but that's something you can do.

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
 And finally, you have to set a goal and work towards it.

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,400
 It's easy to get lost on your way to trying to achieve your goal as a social

151
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,040
 engineer for a specific target, but you shouldn't.

152
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
 You always keep your goal in mind.

153
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,080
 Actually, there's a song, I'm from Latvia, by the way,

154
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
 there's a song by Brainstorm.

155
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
 It's called There Is Something To It.

156
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,920
 And I love the song because it reminds me of one of the parts,

157
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
 one of the internal parts of my social engineering and how I do it.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's in Latvian here, but I'll translate it for you.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
 It goes like this.

160
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,000
 I reached out and got it all.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,360
 According to my list, I was amazed.

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,920
 Man, that's something magical.

163
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,280
 Simply focus on what's important, put in a little effort, and look, you've got it.

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,760
 So yeah, now a bit about Austin.

165
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
 How do you prep for social engineering?

166
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,560
 Open source intelligence is a separate topic all in all itself.

167
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,960
 You can find lots of videos on it.

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,440
 And it basically means we try to collect existing intelligence from

169
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
 openly available sources.

170
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,560
 So without accessing any databases that would require you to hack your

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,000
 government or something like that.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,040
 So what are the sources then?

173
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
 We can, of course, use the web and the dark sense sometimes, even though as

174
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,440
 many of you know it's overrated, but you can take a look in there as well.

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
 Social networks, really important.

176
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,800
 Metadata.

177
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,120
 2023, many companies still do not purge metadata.

178
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,800
 So unless you're a provider, like unless you use Facebook or some kind of Amazon

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,080
 service or something to publish your stuff, if your provider doesn't prune

180
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,360
 that for you, most likely you are, well, the target's employees are publishing

181
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
 stuff with their name on it.

182
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
 And sometimes publishing pictures with GPS locations.

183
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,960
 And all the large social networks, like Meta, for example, they prune the GPS

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,680
 coordinates because the users never learn to do that, which is understandable,

185
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
 I guess.

186
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,560
 Now, network and service scans as well.

187
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
 It depends on your local legislation, if it's how legal it is and how deep

188
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,480
 you can scan.

189
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
 Fingerprinting services, of course.

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,480
 And finally, I can highly recommend the OSINT framework at osintframework.com.

191
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 It's a small sample of it.

192
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
 So basically you click on a category.

193
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,000
 It's a mind map.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,560
 And on the leaves of the tree, you have different resources that you can use

195
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,680
 for assisting your social media attempts.

196
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,960
 Now for web, you can, of course, use Google Dorks like that, like that, or like

197
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,240
 that, or like that.

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,160
 These are just some examples that I use.

199
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,400
 But I think in ExploitDB, they are the subcategory for Google Dorks.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 I don't like that.

201
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,560
 I mean, I suggest you learn the actual qualifiers for Google or other search

202
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,360
 engines you use, and that's quite cool.

203
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,640
 Of course, you can also get cached web pages.

204
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
 Some other URLs.

205
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
 Pastebin.

206
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,280
 Sometimes at hacker conferences or during leaks, people paste stuff on Pastebin,

207
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,800
 online comments and news sites, different maps.

208
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 It's really important to have different map sources.

209
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,920
 So if you want to scout a location without actually driving to it, different map

210
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 sources will have what?

211
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,840
 They will have different dates for their live photos or for their aerial photos.

212
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,640
 So you get different perspectives.

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 Webcams.

214
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
 There are a bunch of it.

215
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,640
 People usually leave the password to the password so you can connect and take a look.

216
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,320
 Preemptively, Web Archive work for real archiving purposes.

217
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,120
 TNI, like reverse image search, it's the first one that's dedicated to reverse image

218
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,840
 search.

219
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 It's okay.

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,560
 Once again, it provides different results than, for example, Google or Microsoft

221
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 Search.

222
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,720
 Blockchain info if you're doing stuff with blockchain.

223
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,240
 Shodan I/O or sensors I/O, you can use that as well.

224
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,640
 And different leaks.

225
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,720
 I collect leaks because they're sometimes useful.

226
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,040
 You have a database, you can take a look in there.

227
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,840
 Now, to close down the web section of OSSAN.

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
 There are different people search engines.

229
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:23,520
 SyncMe was really, really cool until 2019 because GDPR came in 2018 and it's

230
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,120
 screwed with us being able to easily access it.

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,880
 So SyncMe basically worked in a way that their selling point was there's this app, you

232
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,840
 install the app on your phone, and if an unknown number calls you, it shows you the name of

233
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,320
 the person calling you.

234
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,720
 Now, in the license agreement, in the user agreement for the app, it said we're going

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,640
 to transfer your phone book to our servers.

236
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,920
 So what you could also do is you could put any random number in there and you could get

237
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,520
 the name and surname of the person.

238
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,240
 Even the president of my country, Latvia, was there back in the day when I tested it first.

239
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
 You can also use Google Dork for searching people, of course.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,400
 Different public registries, so-called deep web, which is not indexed, but every country

241
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,320
 has their public registries.

242
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,360
 Many of them in Europe at least are publicly available because of transparency.

243
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
 Online news and so on.

244
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:19,240
 And also we have these additional resources for web that are quite useful.

245
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
 For social networks, there are different social networks.

246
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,600
 Any one that you can imagine, these are the ones that I found most useful in my escapades.

247
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
 And account recovery process sometimes gives nice info.

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,920
 Now, even if your goal is not to take over an account, you can still get some digits

249
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,280
 from phone number or a domain from an email address of a person of anonymous account.

250
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,800
 Very valuable, awesome tools on the site, especially for social networks, different readymade tools.

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,440
 Nothing super hacky or super fancy, but it's all in there so you don't have to waste time

252
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
 searching approaches for separate social networks.

253
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 Right on.

254
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,520
 So the next or the first step is pretext.

255
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,880
 We talked about it just a bit, now we can talk about it more.

256
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,480
 So it's part of the preparation.

257
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,080
 Preparation has basically two parts.

258
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,320
 You research your mark, the person you're going to be attacking, and you prepare yourself.

259
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,240
 And in preparing yourself, pretext is really important.

260
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,960
 So what's your role?

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,800
 Meaning who do you want to play today?

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
 Are you going to be the CEO?

263
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
 Or are you going to be the employee that has lost their password?

264
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,320
 Or are you going to be the mother of an employee in distress?

265
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,440
 And your mother sometimes can be really convincing on the phone.

266
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,120
 But my kid is, "No, no, no, problem, problem."

267
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,720
 "Okay, I don't want to deal with that, here's your password."

268
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,520
 So that's really important.

269
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,760
 But don't make it too crazy.

270
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,720
 Don't go, "Hello, this is Napoleon Bonaparte and I'm calling you because your password

271
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
 has expired."

272
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,800
 Doesn't work, I think.

273
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,760
 So it has to be something realistic.

274
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:14,840
 And by the way, before we go to that, one more thing, be ready for challenges.

275
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,680
 When choosing your persona, for example, where I come from, a big part of the celebrations

276
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,320
 that we have is name days, right?

277
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,760
 Every person, every name, every first name that the person has is in the calendar on

278
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,480
 a specific day.

279
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,960
 So if you're John or Peter or Anna, you best know when your date is in the calendar because

280
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,880
 people sometimes ask in my experience.

281
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,520
 So you have to think about the questions that we'll ask.

282
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,420
 But we're going to get back to that in just a sec.

283
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,520
 So next thing is why are you doing this?

284
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,960
 And it ties to choosing your persona.

285
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:54,280
 So during pretext, you have to choose a role that facilitates what you're trying to do

286
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
 here, right?

287
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,880
 Maybe choosing CEO of a company if you forgot your password may be good in some cases, but

288
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
 probably not the most optimal one.

289
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,400
 Probably choosing a really annoying and critical employee would be best for that.

290
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,600
 So make sure that your role that you've chosen matches your goal that you're trying to achieve.

291
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,660
 And once again, you really have to convince yourself first that you're really that person

292
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,240
 that you're pretending to be, that you're playing.

293
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,120
 I'm going to give you once again some tips in the end, some practical tips, and improv

294
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,280
 is what really, really helped me.

295
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,960
 Because I do actually get the feeling that I'm that person for that second, for that

296
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,280
 minute, for that half an hour, how long that interaction is going to go.

297
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
 And you have to challenge yourself.

298
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,080
 If it doesn't work for you, you can ask help from friend.

299
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
 But if it doesn't, simply try.

300
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,120
 Okay, so I mean, we have some hackers here, I imagine.

301
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
 You like to find bugs, right?

302
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,740
 You try to find vulnerabilities, holes.

303
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,840
 So you have to try to find some holes in your story.

304
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,520
 See what happens if they ask me this?

305
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,360
 Am I really that person?

306
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,960
 Well, maybe what if they ask me for a D card, right?

307
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,920
 It may happen.

308
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,720
 You have to, I mean, it doesn't mean you have to always make a fake ID card, which is a

309
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
 technique, a valid technique.

310
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,000
 But you have to be ready with a response.

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,840
 And by response, I don't mean necessarily verbal response.

312
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,040
 I mean, if you decide that you're going to run, you can decide that you're going to run.

313
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,600
 But you have to decide beforehand.

314
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:37,120
 It shouldn't be decision made there and then.

315
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,700
 So a bit about human behavior and decision making.

316
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,800
 So the things that we're going to work with as social engineers, one of the things is

317
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,320
 everyone loves to help.

318
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,520
 Most people love to help, right?

319
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,200
 Also, people generally try to avoid conflict.

320
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
 Most people don't thrive on conflict.

321
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 They don't like it.

322
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 So if they are faced with a reasonable choice of having an argument or not having an argument,

323
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,160
 many of them will choose to not have an argument.

324
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,760
 Now then, there are some people that in life have built up a skill enough that they make

325
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,040
 consistently good decisions.

326
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,360
 Most people make good decisions on the best effort basis.

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,960
 And a rare person can make a good decision when rushed.

328
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,480
 So that's another aspect that we can use.

329
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,480
 We can try and ask the person to hurry up.

330
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,160
 Which is why the scammers that try to give you a million dollars actually say you have

331
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,920
 20 minutes to do this, otherwise money is gone.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,560
 Because that's just human nature.

333
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,480
 Now, there is an exception or some exceptions to the first part where everyone loves to

334
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 help.

335
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,240
 There are some hard targets.

336
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,300
 Some roles that are, you know, when you've mastered basic social engineering, you go

337
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,340
 and try to socialise those guys.

338
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,700
 Like guards or people that are trained to work with external customers that try to lie

339
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
 to them.

340
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,100
 I'll give you an example.

341
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:15,100
 Let's say you wanted to get a free ticket to something, right?

342
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,100
 And you've got the ticket place and you say, okay, so my name is this and this and I have

343
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
 a ticket reserved.

344
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,160
 If the person is trained to work with customers, they will ask you for proof of ID or QR code

345
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 or something, right?

346
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,740
 But if you manage to somehow go to someone that is not trained to work with customers,

347
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,760
 to a middle manager or go just outside the working hours where the customer person is

348
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,120
 gone, they may not know what to do.

349
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,240
 So that's the easy target.

350
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,940
 I have a story about guards that I'd like to share for the first time publicly.

351
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:00,720
 So I was active in the student politics movement many years ago and every year in September

352
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,200
 there are big celebrations all over the country, of course, new students coming in.

353
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,160
 And I was in student politics so I had some drinks lined up with the rector of university.

354
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,600
 And the drinks were happening in the same place where the big event was happening, right?

355
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 And to get to the rector's place, I had to go through the VIP.

356
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,880
 And the organizer at the time didn't want to give me the VIP.

357
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,320
 So I went, took a look at the VIP bracelets.

358
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,340
 They were black paper bracelets with text VIP on it.

359
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,160
 We have bracelets in the office, so I opened up the cabinet, I grabbed the black bracelet,

360
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,940
 didn't print VIP on it, didn't even try to write it by hand, so just a black bracelet.

361
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
 So I got into VIP.

362
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,120
 I was chilling with the rector.

363
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,840
 And the tradition is at midnight, the rector and some student leaders and invited guests

364
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,440
 go to the stage to sing a song.

365
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,880
 And I was dragged along with.

366
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,460
 So we are backstage waiting for the singing song.

367
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,920
 So now the student organizers know that I don't have the VIP.

368
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,200
 So they talk to a guard and say, "Hey, check that guy out.

369
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,320
 He shouldn't be here."

370
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 And I hear that.

371
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 So that's one of the things of social engineering.

372
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,200
 You have to be receptive to different things happening around you.

373
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 So I hear that.

374
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
 And now I have, I don't know how many seconds at the time, but in reality I had 15 seconds

375
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,520
 to think because you can't prepare everything.

376
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,000
 I had 15 seconds to decide what I'm going to do when the guard comes.

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,080
 And I decided to move the bracelet.

378
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,760
 Well, it was an event with suits, right?

379
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
 So I had a suit.

380
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
 I decided to move the bracelet on my hand.

381
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,080
 So I was going to play, I don't have a bracelet.

382
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 It worked.

383
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,680
 So he came to me and asked me if I could show the bracelets.

384
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,280
 And I told him I'm his rector.

385
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,480
 He went away.

386
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
 That's it.

387
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,400
 If I were to show him the black bracelet without VIP on it, we might have had a different

388
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
 discussion.

389
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 So you have to be on your toes.

390
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 Right.

391
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
 Let's move forward.

392
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,640
 So how to leverage social normativity in persistent situations.

393
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,080
 I'm just going to give you some examples here.

394
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,640
 The first one isn't actually mine.

395
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,080
 It's from a colleague, a fellow social engineer from the US.

396
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,680
 And they sometimes post these stories on how they do social engineering engagement.

397
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,040
 I really love this part.

398
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,120
 So in their company where they work, they have a fake pregnancy belly that you can put

399
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,360
 on.

400
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,560
 So they have a female employee.

401
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,740
 And at this specific engagement, she puts on the belly.

402
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,920
 She goes to Starbucks, asks for many, many coffees, as many as you can.

403
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 Not coffees, cups.

404
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,160
 She fills the cups with water, so it's cheaper.

405
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 And then tries to get in.

406
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 Right?

407
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,120
 Who the hell would not open the door?

408
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 Right?

409
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
 And that's people.

410
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
 That's it.

411
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
 People like to be nice.

412
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
 Right?

413
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,600
 And are you going to close the door in her face?

414
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
 Probably not.

415
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,480
 And you don't even -- mostly you don't even need all that.

416
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,360
 You just tailgate someone, and if it's a large enough company, if it's rush hour, when do

417
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 we have rush hour?

418
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Well, during lunch.

419
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 Right?

420
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,480
 So people return from lunch in throws.

421
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
 Then when you can do it, that's the best time.

422
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,480
 And people are unlikely to close the door in your face.

423
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,820
 Which is, you know, I mean, we do defensive work as well, and it's really hard to advise

424
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,600
 my customers what to do.

425
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 It's human nature.

426
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,080
 You can't really fix this.

427
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,480
 Unless you do some physical things like man traps where you can't physically walk in.

428
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,200
 But it's a different story.

429
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
 Then you can, of course, just ask for a favor.

430
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,920
 And if you have enough time, you just wait for a good hair day.

431
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 Right?

432
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
 When the person is happy.

433
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,560
 When the person is shining, then you go and ask, can I get free upgrade to business class,

434
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
 please?

435
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
 Sometimes works.

436
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
 Yeah.

437
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:10,800
 I mean, one important thing about corporate world is that usually, mostly, like 99% of

438
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,960
 the time, you're not talking to the people who own the company's money.

439
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
 Right?

440
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,840
 The employee doesn't care if the company loses a couple hundred euros.

441
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,200
 It's not, I mean, not their problem.

442
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,600
 Then one more thing is you can hint at creating conflict and provide an easy way to avoid

443
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
 it.

444
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,920
 And it's really important that there is an easy way to avoid it.

445
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,000
 Myself, I'm struggling with this one here personally.

446
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,360
 I sometimes entice a bit too much of a conflict and then the person logs down because they

447
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,480
 see, okay, there's no way out of this.

448
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,560
 I'm going to buckle down.

449
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,000
 So it has to be light.

450
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,520
 And it can't be above the pay grade of whom you're targeting.

451
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,880
 So if you're talking to an employee, service level, first level support, and they don't

452
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,560
 have the possibility to waive the fees that you want to get waived, then it's not going

453
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
 to work either.

454
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,280
 You have to escalate it first in some way.

455
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
 All right.

456
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,960
 So the next part is on building rapport and trust.

457
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,080
 I decided to not talk about it because of time constraints.

458
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,160
 But I do have a presentation from 2017 at OpenFest.

459
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,080
 It's on lobbying.

460
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,120
 And half of it is about building rapport and trust.

461
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,800
 So it basically talks about how to get people to talk to you or how to get people to like

462
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 you.

463
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,040
 So you can take a look at it if you want to work with that part.

464
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,680
 But what's important for social engineering is that this part of building rapport and

465
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,060
 trust can be short, can be really short, and can be very long.

466
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,700
 So I'll give you two contrasting examples.

467
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,440
 For the short one, imagine a scammer somewhere.

468
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,400
 And I don't like it, but they are also social engineers.

469
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,400
 So a scammer somewhere sending you emails saying, I'm an Napoleon Bonaparte and I owe

470
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,540
 you $1 million.

471
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,340
 You can just pay me $100 and I'm going to transfer to you real quick.

472
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,660
 And in emails like that, they try to build trust right there in the same email.

473
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,900
 So it takes a couple seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds.

474
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,220
 It's not really effective for most people, but it's a method.

475
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,660
 And for some cases, it works.

476
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,420
 Now it can also be very long.

477
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:22,880
 For example, if you want to do whaling, which means social engineering an important person,

478
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,920
 then what you can do is you can try to approach them on a social network.

479
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,760
 Now whales will usually not approve random social network requests.

480
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,420
 So what you do is you befriend their employees or colleagues or whomever with a fake profile.

481
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,260
 That looks legit.

482
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,560
 And when you have a lot of them, like 20, 30, 40, then you can try to send a friend

483
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,160
 request as whale.

484
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,480
 And then they say, oh, okay, it looks like one of one of my guys.

485
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,760
 And then they accept.

486
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,100
 So it can be really long and really short.

487
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,780
 Now for exploiting trust, it's kind of the easy part, right?

488
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
 When you're in, then you just ask, but not really.

489
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,180
 If you ask the wrong question, then you're immediately out without getting what you need.

490
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,980
 First of all, always keep the goal of that specific interaction in mind.

491
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:22,120
 So let's say I wanted to get the username and password for the web page server of CCC, right?

492
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,780
 On my first interaction, I cannot ask the person I'm calling, hey, what's the password?

493
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,400
 It will not work.

494
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,380
 I have to set the goal for the interaction.

495
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,420
 That goal might be, well, I want to know what kind of operating system it runs, right?

496
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,540
 Well, I could do it via also in line network scans, for example, right?

497
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,620
 But I could also ask, right?

498
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,980
 Or I could do the username thing, right?

499
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
 What's the username?

500
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,540
 Step by step.

501
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,360
 So always keep that in mind.

502
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,140
 And don't ask too much at the same time.

503
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,220
 I'll give you an example from corporate world.

504
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,340
 So if it's a lockdown system and you can't really find anything from online, even though

505
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,900
 you could use job advertisements, for example, right?

506
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,100
 If they're searching for Windows 98 engineers, then you know they're running Windows 98,

507
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
 right?

508
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,580
 Those are not many of them left.

509
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,820
 Right.

510
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,900
 But in all seriousness, some companies like banks or airline industry uses some old stuff,

511
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,460
 which is really fun.

512
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
 But first you have to get in.

513
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,820
 And getting in is what we're going to talk about here today, right?

514
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,460
 So on the first call, I might try to find out what operating systems are actually running.

515
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,220
 And you don't always have to ask direct questions.

516
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,500
 For example, if I choose that my role is a user calling tech support, it would be kind

517
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,300
 of dumb of me to ask, hey, what operating system are we running?

518
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,180
 It could work because tech support expects users to be like that.

519
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,980
 But I could also be a bit smarter.

520
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,780
 For example, I could not ask that directly.

521
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,020
 I could do a different thing, right?

522
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,740
 I could say my computer isn't working.

523
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,380
 And they would say, okay, so what do you see?

524
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,260
 And I would mumble something like, well, it's not working.

525
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
 But what's on the screen?

526
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,060
 And they say, well, the usual thing.

527
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,980
 And then at some point, they get pissed off and they just get really angry.

528
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,580
 And they say, okay, do you see that logo with this color, that color, and that color in

529
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
 the lower left corner?

530
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
 Uh-huh.

531
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,660
 And I say, well, I don't know.

532
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,100
 Is it round?

533
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,220
 And then I get the Windows version as well.

534
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,620
 So you can see, and they think they are requesting information, right?

535
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,580
 But actually, they are the ones transferring bits of information to you.

536
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
 Right.

537
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,500
 So yeah, and then when I have that, then I can actually call someone else.

538
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,900
 Important, don't call the same person.

539
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,740
 Call someone else and try to find out how the usernames are made.

540
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,300
 Is it first name, last name?

541
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
 Is there a dot in between?

542
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,820
 Is it some letters, right?

543
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:01,020
 Many corporations still, at least the middle ones and the small ones, still use really

544
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,220
 dumb default passwords.

545
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,860
 And some of them, in my experience, do not allow employees to change them.

546
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,780
 So if you find the template of the password, then you can more easily brute force hashes.

547
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
 Right?

548
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,780
 Or you can even, you know...

549
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,260
 The goal here, in any case, is to build trust with the next person, the next person as well,

550
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,780
 to pretend that you're one of them.

551
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,180
 And if you have the in-house knowledge, it's easier to do that.

552
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
 It's easier to pretend.

553
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
 Okay.

554
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:38,260
 Now, let's go to the practical part, which is the last part of the presentation.

555
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,060
 I'm going to start with some non...

556
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
 Oh.

557
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
 LibreOffice.

558
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,940
 I'm going to start with some non-social engineering exercises.

559
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,740
 Actually, it's good that we have that.

560
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,020
 So you can try to do it with your friends first, right?

561
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,980
 It doesn't have to be like someone...

562
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
 Some adversary, right?

563
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,220
 Someone you trust, someone you can play along with, right?

564
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
 Okay.

565
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
 Was that out of the way?

566
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,500
 So, first of all, talking to people.

567
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,320
 It's the first step, right?

568
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,460
 So I'm sorry if there are people here that don't like to talk to people, and if your intent

569
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,140
 on keeping it that way, then social engineering is not for you, maybe.

570
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,020
 Or you can try emails or stuff like that, or writing some fake apps.

571
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
 Yeah.

572
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,180
 So talking to people is the first thing, and just try it.

573
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
 Like these guys here.

574
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,820
 You can just try talking to each other.

575
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
 Improv.

576
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,940
 Believe it or not, but until 16 years old, I didn't even talk to anyone.

577
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,420
 I didn't talk to my own classmates.

578
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,020
 I didn't want to talk to anyone.

579
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
 Improv is a cool thing.

580
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
 It still happens somewhere.

581
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,660
 I'm sure all over Germany, all over the world, if you can sign up for Improv, it also helps

582
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,740
 you to be on your toes when you're challenged, and then you can think of something real quick.

583
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,820
 Alternative personas.

584
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,860
 In your daily life, you can just try to pretend to be someone else.

585
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,540
 Once again, not trying to target anyone.

586
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,540
 Just walking around.

587
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,660
 You can walk around the camp.

588
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,500
 You can pretend to be...

589
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,420
 Well, don't pretend to be anything critical, please.

590
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:13,240
 But you can pretend to be anyone you like, and just make up a story.

591
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,100
 Not for malicious purposes here, or anything in this presentation is not for malicious purposes,

592
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
 by the way.

593
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,060
 Seriously, guys.

594
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,860
 It's a...

595
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,980
 Yeah.

596
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,980
 But just make up a fake persona, right?

597
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,460
 I remember when I was actually doing...

598
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:38,780
 Back when I was doing Improv, and I was hitchhiking all over Europe during summers, I liked to...

599
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,520
 When I got to a city, I liked to randomly walk up to people and get them to tell me their

600
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,940
 life story.

601
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:50,540
 And my goal there was to have more material that I would digest, and not directly present,

602
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:56,260
 of course, that I would digest and include bits and pieces of that in my Improv later

603
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
 on.

604
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,580
 And in order to get them to open up better, I would take on an alternative persona.

605
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,820
 So that's something you can do.

606
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,620
 And then, of course, you can pretend to be someone else online.

607
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,540
 Catfishing is not what I'm talking about here.

608
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
 Someone else with a story, right?

609
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:21,740
 So there's a thing called the post secret.

610
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,740
 Some of you know it.

611
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:31,820
 And recently, there was a postcard from someone that wrote that I go to teens' forums, and

612
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:39,980
 I talk to people who are contemplating doing suicide.

613
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,380
 And I tell them I'm a 43-year-old guy that coaches a metal band, and I'm actually a 16-year-old

614
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,140
 girl, and I've prevented five suicides so far.

615
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:57,220
 So pretending someone else online can be really beneficial as well, and beneficial for you

616
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,740
 as well to train your social engineering skills.

617
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,580
 Now then, when we've trained that, you can start with passive acquisition methods.

618
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,500
 They don't require you to actually talk to people.

619
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,780
 And you can dig for some trash.

620
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,820
 You can eavesdrop on nearby employees.

621
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,860
 Once again, my ears, my eyes are always open when I'm even communicating with people.

622
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,740
 Let's say I'm at an agency of some kind, like a travel agency.

623
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,300
 I'm talking to one person here while I'm doing that.

624
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
 And it's a skill you can build.

625
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
 You can try to train.

626
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,940
 It's easy when you're not talking.

627
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,460
 It's harder when you're trying to listen to what the person is telling you when you try

628
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,380
 to listen at the next table as well.

629
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,740
 And it's really hard when you try to talk and listen to what those people are telling,

630
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
 saying.

631
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,740
 But you can do that.

632
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:47,860
 So you can try to eavesdrop on other people's stuff, and just to build a skill.

633
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,140
 You can also shoulder surf.

634
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,140
 The cool thing about shoulder surfing these days is it doesn't matter if it's a laptop

635
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
 or a phone.

636
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,100
 If you're sitting here with your phone out, someone behind you can see what's on your

637
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,180
 screen.

638
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,900
 They can also see your keyboard even easier on a laptop.

639
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,620
 If a person types fast, then they also can read what you're typing fast, even if it's

640
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,980
 a password.

641
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,540
 So that's another skill you can hone.

642
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,100
 Now bump into people, like physically.

643
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,900
 Well, not here.

644
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,420
 It's against God of Conduct here.

645
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
 It's serious stuff.

646
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,860
 Don't do that, please.

647
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,340
 But you know, on train somewhere.

648
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,340
 What's the goal here?

649
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,740
 Well, the goal is to try and copy an RFID tag that they have.

650
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,620
 Bumping into people is the way to go.

651
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,380
 And there are two criteria that you should meet.

652
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,220
 So you can make it a game, a single-player game.

653
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:45,420
 One is bump in the most appropriate way that is most conducive to tag copying.

654
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,940
 And the second way is bump in a way that is the most natural.

655
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,320
 So you have these two criteria.

656
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,460
 You can try one, you can try the other.

657
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,820
 When you win, try to do both at the same time.

658
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,500
 And then you have your skill.

659
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,260
 Now then you build some pretext.

660
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,700
 And we talked about building pretext already.

661
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,740
 So you try to think what you're going to do, who you're going to be, and how are you going

662
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,820
 to be challenged.

663
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,100
 Now be uncooperative where you can.

664
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,500
 This is how I still try to improve my social engineering skill on a daily basis.

665
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,420
 For example, you can hide your wristband and see if someone challenges you.

666
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,900
 And that's a really important part here.

667
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,780
 Without the presentation, you should stay legal.

668
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,700
 You should have the right to do whatever you're doing.

669
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,040
 You can hide your wristband and if someone challenges you, see if you can talk your way

670
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
 out of it.

671
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,140
 Yeah, I'm with the org, or I'm emergency, or I'm going to scan my QR code in one hour.

672
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,220
 The angels here are really cool.

673
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,180
 I'm one of them as well.

674
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,340
 Don't be terrible to angels.

675
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
 Be nice to them.

676
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,780
 Be nice to everybody.

677
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,220
 But if you have the wristband and you don't waste too much of their time, and they're

678
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,420
 standing there being bored, you can play around, I think.

679
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,980
 You can smile, be friendly and agreeable.

680
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,100
 As a rule, it also opens people up.

681
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,180
 It's easier to talk to them that way.

682
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,860
 And you can be vague in your responses if you're challenged.

683
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,780
 I actually use this one and the next one to get out of E-gates on borders.

684
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,940
 I don't think I've ever scanned my document on an E-gate when entering or leaving the

685
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,500
 European Union.

686
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,220
 In many countries, I think in all countries, it's not mandatory.

687
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,540
 Stuff sometimes doesn't work.

688
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,020
 Sometimes it doesn't work, so you go to an agent.

689
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,300
 And I'm doing this to train myself.

690
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,700
 For example, I was returning to my own country with documents in order and everything, but

691
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,740
 I just thought, okay, I'm going to play.

692
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,420
 So when I was approaching the border in the airport, I saw a lady that was going to direct

693
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,120
 me to the E-gate.

694
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,140
 And she asked if I have my passport.

695
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,500
 And I said I have my documentation with me.

696
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,620
 And she asked if I'm from Latvia.

697
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,300
 I said, "Hmm?"

698
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,660
 And a couple of questions later, she sent me to a person to actually get checked into

699
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,780
 the country.

700
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,180
 Then you can also be dumb.

701
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:26,060
 Again, I used this one to get out of E-gates in a different country abroad.

702
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:32,520
 So you know why I hate E-gates and backscatter scanners?

703
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,020
 Because I know programmers.

704
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,300
 I hate technology.

705
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,180
 I mean, there are bugs in there, for sure.

706
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:42,880
 And I don't want to get caught up in some holding cell because of a bug.

707
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,580
 So I always try to get to a person right in there.

708
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,700
 So basically, I was walking straight through, so the setup was no barriers, nothing like

709
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,260
 that, five machines here, five machines there, and you could walk straight through.

710
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,380
 So I was doing that, and someone stopped me and asked, and appointed the machine.

711
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,140
 And I gave them my passport, like, do what you want.

712
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,060
 And they gave it back to me and appointed the machine.

713
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
 So I looked at the machine.

714
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
 It said language.

715
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
 I pressed English.

716
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,340
 It said, "Please scan your passport."

717
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,280
 I put my passport in the machine.

718
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,820
 And it showed a photo of my face in real time with no text on it.

719
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,540
 So I was standing like that for 30 seconds, and then it had some timer on there on screen

720
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
 and then said, "Thank you."

721
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,300
 So I took my passport and I went through.

722
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,700
 I mean, it didn't do anything illegal.

723
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,980
 I mean, I wasn't given an instruction to scan my face or anything.

724
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
 Right.

725
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,140
 So then you can continue with simple everyday things.

726
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,660
 For example, airport fast track, right?

727
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,420
 Some of you fly a lot, if you have miles or other qualifications, you get airport fast

728
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,260
 track so you can try to not present your qualifications there and just try to convince them.

729
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,020
 Say your flight is late or...

730
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,660
 One time I did by accident this year.

731
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,780
 I didn't know that my qualifications only apply to specific airline.

732
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
 I thought it was airport.

733
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
 But I said, "Yeah, okay.

734
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
 You're here already.

735
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,780
 We'll go through.

736
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,060
 We're going to put you through as an exception."

737
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,900
 Right.

738
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
 And oh, another thing.

739
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,500
 I was doing a technical inspection, like technical qualification of my motorbike recently, and

740
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,020
 I was going to get failed because of one thing not working on it.

741
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,220
 Well, it's a passenger thing, not really important.

742
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,860
 So the guy comes to me and says, "This thing doesn't work."

743
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,940
 And I immediately, without hesitation, and forcefully say, "Yeah, it does."

744
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,180
 And I show him it's partially working.

745
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,260
 He goes, "Oh, okay.

746
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,260
 Looks like it works."

747
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,300
 Finally, what not to do?

748
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,460
 Do not try to leave with stuff without paying.

749
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,340
 That's theft.

750
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,300
 At least offline.

751
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,740
 Do not provide a fake identity to government agencies.

752
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,540
 That can probably land you in a lot of pain.

753
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,420
 Do not damage your property.

754
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,340
 Also can land you in trouble.

755
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:07,340
 And my personal policy for the fourth point here is, if you do social engineering, that

756
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:13,260
 could result in you getting any financial benefit, make sure that you've paid for it as well.

757
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,100
 I'll give you two examples.

758
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,220
 For example, business launches, when I try to get in, I make sure that I have paid for

759
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,700
 it before I try to convince them to let me in for free.

760
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,840
 Or we were hacking, 10 years ago, I think we were hacking Latvian, well, Latvian capital's

761
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,100
 Riga transportation system, public transportation tickets.

762
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,700
 And we hacked them successfully, and when we were filming the video, we actually paid

763
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,420
 for the whole day for us to write for money, so that we could write with a fake thing as

764
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,220
 well and make a video.

765
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,060
 So it's a good ethical thing to do, I think.

766
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,260
 Well, thank you so much.

767
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,460
 If we do have some time for questions, we can do questions.

768
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,020
 Slides will be on kudos.org, and you can follow me on Chaos Social.

769
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,900
 My username is K. Thank you so much.

770
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:06,740
 Thank you so much, Kirill.

771
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:13,380
 I think we have time for one question, the one question to rule them all.

772
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,580
 Oh my God.

773
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,580
 Before you start with everything, what kind of precautions do you take on your own identity?

774
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,500
 How do I protect myself?

775
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
 Yes.

776
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,300
 Well, you know, I've done, I think, seven presentations on privacy so far.

777
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,780
 They are on kudos.org, and privacy is really important to me.

778
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:40,540
 But I like to say that I try to stay private for others' sake.

779
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
 It's too late for me.

780
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,540
 I mean, I have hundreds of videos on YouTube with my face and voice.

781
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,540
 You call with your own number?

782
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,780
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,180
 Do I call with my own personal number?

784
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,100
 Oh, no, I use a PO box.

785
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,660
 I call without a number because I don't have an incoming number.

786
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,380
 I use anonymous identities online.

787
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,500
 Basic stuff, yeah.

788
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,180
 But the presentation is called Nothing to Hide.

789
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:10,420
 It's on kudos.org, and you can see it live in Italy in November and in Canada, Quebec

790
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,100
 in October if you want to see the new version of that one.

791
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,100
 Thanks.

792
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:26,180
 And if the people here at Camp want to find you now after this talk, where can they find

793
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
 you?

794
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,620
 Oh, yeah, I have said anonymous numbers.

795
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:36,900
 So you can call me at 5511 or 5522, or if you really want to, then you can do 5533.

796
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,980
 It's a GSM, Dext, and VoIP.

797
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,980
 I'm not a hoarder.

798
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,980
 I promise.

799
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,980
 Thanks.

800
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
 Big round of applause to Kirill.

801
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,100
 Thanks, man.

802
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,460
