 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,400
 Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,600
 It's so nice to see your faces on this beautiful day.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,560
 I'm here to give you a message from C3,

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,120
 Wetterfrosch from C3 Heldesk.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,600
 And we expect a very bright and sunny day with temperatures up to 31 degrees Celsius.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,240
 Please drink enough, use sunscreen, search for shady places.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,000
 Tonight around 11 PM, there might be some thunderstorms passing by north of Sydenyck,

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,480
 so there might be some rain, but this is not confirmed yet.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,840
 But please take care of each other and also look out for your fellow creatures.

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,080
 Also, if you really like Millie Race and the Millie Race stage,

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,760
 you can still support the program and the volunteers providing it by buying

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,800
 Millie Race coins behind me, like making a donation.

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
 And they are very beautiful.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,920
 You can also just look at them and maybe think about it.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,680
 And now, I'm very pleased to announce our speaker today.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,040
 Here is Mike.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:47,320
 Mike is a physicist and working for the Fraunhofer IEE on sustainability topics and

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,040
 technology, and I'm really excited to hear what he's going to tell us about that.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,280
 So hello for Mike, and please give him a warm round of applause.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:04,040
 Yeah, thank you for the nice introduction and thanks for having me here.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
 Thanks to the technical team.

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,080
 Everything seems to be working.

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,320
 I'm Mike.

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,120
 Nice to welcome all of you guys and all the online people.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,480
 And I'd like to talk a little bit about energy transition, especially in Germany,

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,480
 since that's the part I know most about.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,280
 OK, everything's fine.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
 OK, perfect.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,880
 So, and I'd like to talk about not only the energy transition, but also a bit about the ICT.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,680
 I got called two days ago that people are not sure what ICT means.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
 So, sorry for that.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,880
 It means Internet Communication Technologies, which is like the scientific word for everything

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,960
 regarding Internet data communication and so on.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:58,760
 But first of all, I have a short break because I'd like to tell you a little bit about my institute

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,160
 for which I'm working.

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,360
 So we're the Fraunhofer EAA, and we are located in Kassel.

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
 The first slide you could see was a picture of our new building.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,160
 And as you can see, we are about 450 employees and we have an annual budget of about 30 million euros.

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:25,160
 And what we are doing is we did develop technical and economic solutions for the transformation of our energy system.

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,960
 So, and my institute is set up in several different research fields.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
 You can see here.

44
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,160
 And I'm personally working in the grid planning and grid operation field.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,360
 So my talk will be mainly focused about this part.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 So feel free and expect something about grid planning and grid operation.

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
 These are topics normally not known to people.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
 And there's a German guy who's making jokes.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
 Somebody of you might know him.

50
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,560
 He's called Jan Philipp Zimny.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,960
 And he once said in one of his joke programs, he said, OK, what does the normal German know about electricity?

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,560
 Yes, it comes out of a hole in the wall and it tastes like AWA.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,160
 So I'd like to change this a little bit.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,760
 So then let's get started with our power grids and how do they work.

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 So basically, I think all of you know this kind of idea behind this.

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,960
 We have on the left side, we have generating stations like power generators, nuclear power plants and everything.

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:47,360
 And they produce energy which gets stepped up, then transmits over large areas or large distances with high voltages.

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,960
 And then through a transformer near you, it gets stepped down so that you can use it or the industry can use it.

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
 So that's a basic idea behind our power grid.

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,760
 But it gets more complicated if you look in detail into it.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,360
 For example, if you look at the distribution level, you can see the lower voltages.

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,760
 You're not directly connected to a power transformer, but you're connected over several lines and several other transformers.

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,660
 And as you can see, these grids have a different topology.

64
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:28,160
 We call it radially driven, which means you have your substation from where lines radially go away.

65
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,660
 So this means if the line goes out, you don't have any power anymore.

66
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,560
 So that's not cool.

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 And therefore we do n minus 1 safety, which means we calculate, OK, what happens if one line fails?

68
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,360
 And how can we resupply everything?

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
 So the normal answer is to just double everything.

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:57,160
 So as you can see on the left side in the picture, you have like two legs coming to your distribution station and then they can switch between these two legs.

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:08,260
 This is also a nice feature because we can hand over if one leg is too overloaded, we can switch over and can use the other leg to supply your local transformer.

72
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,260
 So the nice thing is these parts are automated, but it depends on the voltage level you're looking at.

73
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:22,360
 So in the transmission system, which is the highest voltage we have, like 380 kV, there everything is automated.

74
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:31,160
 In the low voltage, where you at your home like 20 kV or 400 volts, there's not so much automated at the moment.

75
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,360
 But we're in the process of changing this.

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 And if you take a complete view, you can see it like here.

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,660
 You have the generation, for example, on the left on the right side, and then you have a transmission grid.

78
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,960
 In this example, it's built up like a net.

79
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:58,660
 In German, it's called a Masche, which means that the energy can travel left hand and right hand to the sub transmission station, for example.

80
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:06,060
 And therefore you get currents which will run counterclockwise and clockwise, which makes everything a little bit complicated.

81
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,060
 And therefore everything is automated to be able to control this kind of power.

82
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:20,860
 And if you look in the red box in the lower left, you see that there is a distribution substation which will then step it down and distribute it further.

83
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,560
 And there you can see we don't have these Maschen anymore because there we are feeding the power readily.

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,960
 And therefore sometimes if we have a bad condition, this can lead to power failure.

85
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,860
 And yeah, normally in Germany, we are quite good at managing this kind of stuff.

86
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,460
 So that we have a power availability which is really, really high.

87
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,660
 Like I think we have power loss for less than five minutes a year.

88
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,860
 In other countries, this is not so good.

89
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,760
 I know it from a science project in Italy.

90
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:06,660
 There it was like they had their own unadulterated USB for supplying power because they have power failures of about two to three hours a year.

91
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,060
 So yeah, depends on the power grid and how everything else is.

92
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,860
 But let's take a deeper look.

93
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,860
 A substation is the part you are normally connected to.

94
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
 And how is such a substation built up or set up?

95
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,860
 You can see we have a source at the top and then we have several protection equipment.

96
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,060
 For example, this lightning arrestor, which is for if there's a lightning, it's over voltage.

97
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,360
 Then we have a circuit breaker, which is the same thing you know from your normal household installation.

98
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,860
 We have the possibility to isolate, which means we can simply shut it off.

99
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,860
 And we have other transformers and stuff which will lead or transform down the power to go to you.

100
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:59,060
 So the thing is some of these components are controlled and are remotely controllable.

101
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:08,760
 For example, transformers are normally these big heavy blocks which take a lot of power and transform it down.

102
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:24,260
 And they have or they can have a changeable tap, which means you can change how much or how much voltage they produce by changing like which winding you are using to transform the power down.

103
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,360
 And this part is in the high voltage grids.

104
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,860
 It's automated in the low voltage grids.

105
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,960
 This is normally not automated, but we are at the moment at the point to automate these things.

106
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:45,160
 Also, most of the time they have like a local controller which keeps track of the local voltage and changes the taps accordingly.

107
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,460
 There's one big problem.

108
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,860
 These things are really expensive and take a lot of time to build.

109
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,960
 And as you can see, I've written it here.

110
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,760
 They weigh about 20 to 50 tons.

111
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
 So you need like a crane to supply them.

112
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:08,360
 And if you go and visit a substation, you will see they always have like one spare unit standing around to in case of exchange it.

113
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,360
 So normally there you have two transformers because of n minus one safety.

114
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:23,960
 And these two transformers are normally calculated so that if one transformer fails, the other can take over the whole load because normally building such a transformer takes years.

115
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,260
 So if you need one now, you will have normally to wait a year or even longer.

116
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,060
 And normally they are oil insulated.

117
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,960
 So there is PCB in it.

118
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:42,460
 Please don't ask me what this is especially, but I know it's a very good insulator, but it's probably cancer inducing.

119
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,860
 So yeah, but somehow you need to isolate these things because of the high voltages.

120
00:10:48,860 --> 00:11:03,160
 And I once spoken with the personal, they said normally if they change taps more often because of flashes going in through the tap changing, this is like a big cylinder you rotate and then you can change the taps.

121
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,760
 There you have flashes in it and these flashes can destroy the PCB.

122
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,560
 So they normally change these PCB oil oils quite often.

123
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,660
 And what's also funny, this oil is actively cooled and pumped around in the transformer.

124
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,960
 So you see normally like cooling equipment around it where these oil is cooled.

125
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,860
 So the other big thing we have, which is remotely controllable, are switches.

126
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,860
 These are basically what you know from your normal switch, but they are quite larger.

127
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,260
 And this is just a control box.

128
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,360
 So the switch equipment is more up and you can see in the upper right, there's like these metal rods going up.

129
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,560
 And this system works like that you can either use it by hand.

130
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:57,460
 So you can put in a hand crank and crank the switch on your own or you can toggle a switch and then it will switch or you can send it a command.

131
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,660
 So that when it receives the command, it will go open, it will close and we are using these switches to change topologies.

132
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,060
 For example, you can isolate buses with this.

133
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,260
 You can disconnect stuff.

134
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:16,260
 You can ground buses and so on, which is quite important for getting our power grid to run.

135
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,760
 So how do we control all of this?

136
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,660
 So the networks, as I've told you, is normally remotely controlled.

137
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,760
 Most of the parts even in the high voltage.

138
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
 So but how does this work?

139
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,260
 And now it gets complicated.

140
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,060
 At the moment, most of the systems are using a skater.

141
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:46,860
 And most of them or many of them are using the IEC 6087-5 standard.

142
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,960
 And this is a quite old standard.

143
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:58,360
 As I've written here, it's from the 90s and it's basically a serial connection which has data transfer rates of up to 9k6.

144
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,260
 So we're basically running our whole energy infrastructure with a serial cable.

145
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,060
 So and they've changed this because they needed more power and more data communication speed.

146
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,460
 So they defined the 103 standard extension, which allows for even more faster speeds.

147
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:26,860
 And then the 104 standard is the one which is at the moment widely used because it allows to transport these serial data via TCP/IP.

148
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,560
 So and how does such a packet look?

149
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,460
 I've shown it here.

150
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,760
 If you're interested, Wikipedia has a really good write up about this, how this in detail works.

151
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,760
 But basically you have two kinds of ideas, IDs or addresses.

152
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,160
 So you have a unit identifier and you have an information object.

153
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:54,160
 So you can say, OK, my switch, for example, has an address and it has several sub addresses or identifiers where you can ask, OK, are you open?

154
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,460
 Are you closed?

155
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,760
 Are you healthy?

156
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 Depending on the equipment installed.

157
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,760
 So and if you've seen on the slide beforehand, the system is just doubled.

158
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,560
 Everything you have in the power grid is just doubled.

159
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:16,260
 Even the racks, everything is simply doubled and all the systems are built so that they are able to digest all messages two times.

160
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,660
 So even the switch has two contactors, which are completely physically separated.

161
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,860
 And if one contactor doesn't work and the other one works, you still have a failover in this moment.

162
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:42,360
 So and as you can see, here are some commands defined and these types got also enhanced with the 103 standard for even more or for even better able to do energy related stuff.

163
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,760
 And now comes the 104 standard, which is the one we are using at the moment.

164
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:55,660
 And I liked the quote from Wikipedia, which said the security of 104 by design has proven to be problematic.

165
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:07,660
 So the IEC published a security standard, which is not that well adopted at the moment by most of the network operators.

166
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,560
 So what many of them do is the following.

167
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
 They just use a VPN.

168
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:23,660
 So you have these boxes and I think many of you guys know what these boxes do or that these boxes are interesting on a security standpoint.

169
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:37,260
 And they transfer the communication via VPN tunnel to the light water to the control center where everything gets then controlled and directed and decided.

170
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:48,160
 So and what recently happened was an attack, so to say, on the satellite system of the network.

171
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,460
 And it seems to be that this was not a direct attack on the German energy infrastructure,

172
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,160
 but more or less because the satellite also runs U.S. military communication.

173
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 The problem was somehow the attackers were able to take down the communication to the satellite,

174
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:16,860
 which also was used by wind turbines and meant that the Euroskypark system wasn't able to be reached.

175
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,760
 And then the following happened.

176
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,660
 Eleven gigawatts, which is quite a lot of power of German wind turbines, weren't controllable anymore.

177
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,860
 So they were just running and nobody knew the state of these things.

178
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,160
 It was about 5,800 wind turbines which couldn't be reached anymore.

179
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,660
 So sounds quite devastating.

180
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 But let me tell you, since we know in the energy system that we need to build everything N minus one safety.

181
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:54,160
 So these have local controllers, but these local controllers are basically able to sustain a basic kind of operation.

182
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:02,360
 And as you will see, not being able to control your wind turbines can lead to bigger problems.

183
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,160
 So why has this happened?

184
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,660
 The problem is most of the time wind turbines are put in remote locations.

185
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,760
 And basically you have three kinds of ways to communicate with your wind turbines.

186
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,760
 The first one is you just dig a cable and throw a fiber optic cable to the wind turbine or to the wind park.

187
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,560
 And then you can control everything.

188
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:36,860
 The other version is you have like a mobile connection like normal GSM LTE or directed radio systems.

189
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,360
 And the last option is you use satellite.

190
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 And satellite is like the fallback solution, which always works because satellites.

191
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,160
 And normally you send commands to these stations not that often.

192
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,760
 So that even like clouds or stuff like this is not that big of a deal.

193
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:03,060
 But if you have satellites and the satellite communication breaks down because of other reasons, yeah, you get a problem.

194
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,260
 So let's head on.

195
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,160
 What I'm doing is a power flow calculations.

196
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:19,260
 And this is the part where I want to make a little bit advertisement for a software we are building and we are maintaining.

197
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,360
 And it's called Panda Power.

198
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,760
 So this is a name derived from the fact that we are using pandas, Python, and we are doing power calculations.

199
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
 And therefore it's clear for us that we call it Panda Power.

200
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:44,460
 And if you are interested in learning about how to do power calculations and power flow calculations and want to fiddle around a little bit with the power grid, please go to pandapower.org.

201
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,060
 We are always welcoming pull requests for new features and new stuff.

202
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,760
 And then we have also a sister program, which I don't show today because I want to talk about the power grid.

203
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:09,060
 But also we have also Panda Pipes, which is also open source about calculating flows in pipes so that you are able to simulate water, heat, gas and stuff like this.

204
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,260
 So these are our two big open source softwares.

205
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:21,060
 And as you can see, this is developed by us and the University of Kassel, especially the E2N department.

206
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,360
 This does power flow calculations in Python.

207
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:36,560
 And what a really nice thing is that the Bundesnetz Agentur is using this, our tool, to do the Netz Entwicklungsplan, the development plan for the grid from Germany.

208
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,660
 And they're using our software as a standard to do this.

209
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,760
 So this was quite a big moment for us and we liked it a lot.

210
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,660
 And how does power flow calculation work?

211
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,160
 So don't fear the mathematics on the left side.

212
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,560
 I won't go too much into detail.

213
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,260
 But the basic idea is that the power you inject in a bus needs to be the power that you take out.

214
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,460
 And now you have the Kirchhoff rules.

215
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,660
 Maybe some of you know this from the physics class in your school.

216
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,860
 And it basically says the energy coming in is the energy you take out.

217
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,160
 And if you do more fancy math around it, you can do power flow calculations with it.

218
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 And on the right side, I have a simple version of a grid we've seen earlier with all of the equipment around.

219
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,860
 And you can see we have a grid connection normally, like to a higher voltage level.

220
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,360
 Then we have a transformer.

221
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,560
 And at the bottom, there's a load.

222
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,360
 So what we can do now is we can say to the system, "Okay, this is our grid setup.

223
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,760
 Please do a power flow calculation.

224
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,160
 And if you do this, you will get this kind of result."

225
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,260
 So like I said, it uses pandas under the HUD.

226
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:52,460
 And the problem is for you guys, probably not, but the normal grid operators don't like fancy tables.

227
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,060
 They want to have something they can look at and not just columns of numbers.

228
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,660
 But our tool normally spits out color columns of numbers, as you can see here.

229
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:10,860
 You get result tables where you can see the voltages and the powers and the line loadings for every component in your grid model.

230
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:18,660
 And when your net gets larger, so this is like the case for three buses and one load, so it's quite easy.

231
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,560
 But if your net gets larger, it's getting quite complicated to understand what's happening there.

232
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:34,260
 Therefore, we wrote some kind of visualization which is able to take geographical data to show what's happening in the grid.

233
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,960
 And this you can see here.

234
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,360
 Basically, if you have geodata, you can attach it to your power grid model and then you can run the power flow simulation.

235
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,260
 And then you get a graphics like this.

236
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,760
 Here you can see lines and dots.

237
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,660
 These dots are the buses, substations, as I've shown earlier.

238
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,060
 And the lines are the connecting power lines.

239
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,060
 And the colors will tell you what's up about this.

240
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,860
 So red means overloaded for the lines.

241
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,760
 And for the buses, you have like a per unit voltage level.

242
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,460
 So this means you have multiple factors in your power network.

243
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,760
 On the one hand, you have the power lines which shouldn't get too much current.

244
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,860
 If they get too much current, they tend to get hot.

245
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,860
 And if they get hot, they will get longer and longer and they will start to sag.

246
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,560
 And if they touch anything, you have a big problem.

247
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,060
 So this is mainly the part you want to keep track of.

248
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,760
 And on the other hand, you have your buses and you need to monitor the voltage on the buses.

249
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,960
 Maybe you've seen this on your power supplies for your computer nets, for your laptops and so on.

250
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,160
 And there's normally written a voltage range on it, like 200 volts until 240 or 250 volts.

251
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,760
 There are also the modern power supplies which can handle 100 volts or 90 volts to 260 volts.

252
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,960
 This is basically what you see here.

253
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:11,560
 Normally, we give the voltage in a PU per unit measure, which means we normalize it to the voltage level of the bus.

254
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,860
 So if we have a 20 kV bus, then one PU means 20 kV.

255
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,160
 So it is defined to diverge about 10 percent, so plus 5 and minus 5 percent.

256
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,560
 I know it's a bit complicated, but you can see this on the right scale.

257
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:35,460
 The right color map is for the bus voltages. And as you can see in this example, all the buses are blue,

258
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:43,160
 which means that they are in a good state and are not overloaded, except for in the upper left corner of this example.

259
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:50,960
 So if you want to try this, this is the MV Oberrein network, which is included in Panda Power for playing around, basically.

260
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,560
 And you can see there are some lines which are red.

261
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,760
 Red means bad, so this is normally the part where we need to do something.

262
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:07,960
 And how do you derive normally such kind of geodata if it's not provided?

263
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,960
 Therefore, we've written a plug-in for this, which you can see here, which is a QGIS plug-in,

264
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,560
 which allows you to import and export Panda Power networks into QGIS,

265
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,560
 and where you can use QGIS to draw basically buses and lines based on OSM data.

266
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,360
 And therefore, we are at the next point. The problem is how do we get such grid models?

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,560
 Not always are we getting the grid models from grid operators,

268
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:45,360
 because to be honest, much of our grid isn't digitalized at the moment.

269
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:54,160
 So yeah, the biggest grid architectures you can get, but if you go deeper and deeper and deeper in the distribution levels,

270
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,360
 sometimes you only have paper plans.

271
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,760
 And these paper plans are written by people who are very good at doing electrical stuff,

272
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
 but they don't have geodata.

273
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,960
 So you have an electrical circuit plan before you, and you don't know where these lines are.

274
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,960
 And you're basically sitting there and trying to get everything somehow mixed together.

275
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,360
 And not always in all projects we are working together with grid operators,

276
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,160
 so we needed some other ways to figure out how to derive such grid data.

277
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,960
 And I think this is an interesting part, that's why I'm talking a little bit about it.

278
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,160
 How can we derive grid data from open source data, data sources?

279
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,960
 So the first point, as always, is the open street map.

280
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,560
 And as you can see here, this is Flosim.

281
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,160
 This is like an overlay for open street map, but basically it uses parts from open street map,

282
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,760
 like for example the locations of the lines and where the lines are running.

283
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,160
 And here you can see an example from Schleswig-Holstein.

284
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,160
 You can see Sylt in the upper left corner.

285
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,760
 And you can see all of the power lines and you can see the generation units drawn in here.

286
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,560
 And this you can just query via an API.

287
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,560
 I've made once the thing that I looked deeply into it,

288
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:27,160
 and most of the stuff in Schleswig-Holstein was entered into OSM by a guy called Bahnpirat.

289
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:36,160
 And I'm eager to meet him because he has done so much for this data acquisition.

290
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,360
 And I'm so thankful because we can make science projects in Schleswig-Holstein

291
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,760
 because he is, I don't know, running around and putting in like the power lines.

292
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,760
 So I'm very eager to get to know him.

293
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
 Maybe you guys can drop him a note.

294
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,160
 I don't know, I'd like to talk to him.

295
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
 But this is only the grid.

296
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,560
 Now you can derive some kind of grid architecture.

297
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,360
 You know where the power plants are, you know where the lines are and where the buses are.

298
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,760
 You can put this into Panda Power, but then you're missing generation data.

299
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,960
 And this is the next point.

300
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,360
 Here you can see a Renewables.Ninja.

301
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,960
 This is also an open source project or open source system

302
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,560
 where you can just select a region on the world and can download the generation data.

303
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,960
 And these are based on satellite data.

304
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,960
 I've written it here, the NASA MIRRA reanalysis and the CMSAFS-SARA data set.

305
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,960
 The nice thing is you get this as power schedule.

306
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
 So you can just take this and plug it directly into Panda Power

307
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,360
 and then you know how much Renewables you are generating.

308
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,960
 Quite fun.

309
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,160
 Now we don't not only need the generation, we also need the consumption.

310
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,960
 And consumption is a bit more complicated

311
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,560
 because this data is normally not available.

312
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:06,960
 But there are many open source projects which has done lots of research in the field of power consumption.

313
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,160
 So you get, for example, standard load profiles, you get synthetic load profiles,

314
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,360
 you get also measured profiles.

315
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,760
 And as I've shown here, the Open Energy Platform,

316
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,560
 there are many different versions of these Open Energy Platforms

317
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,360
 where you can download data sets from different projects

318
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 which will show you how the consumption is, for example,

319
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,560
 for an industrial load or for an electrical vehicle or you name it, you will find something.

320
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,560
 So if you plug everything together, for example, for the Schleswig-Holstein area,

321
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,760
 you get something comparable to this.

322
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,160
 As you can see, Schleswig-Holstein with all of its lines and nodes.

323
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,560
 And this is the EHV, so the high voltage transmission lines

324
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,360
 and also the distribution crits at the 110 kV.

325
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:04,560
 And this is about 600 nodes, so 600 substations with about 500 flex providers,

326
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:12,360
 which is like the over category for wind parks, power to X, batteries, electrolyzers, and so on and so on.

327
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,560
 This is what I'm showing here coming from an old project we've done.

328
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,560
 It's called the NAV 4.0, which was the idea to look into the Schleswig-Holstein

329
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,760
 and find a path for the future how we can use more of the wind power in Schleswig-Holstein.

330
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,560
 And this is the key point for the next minutes of my talk,

331
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,360
 because if we look into the installed power in Schleswig-Holstein,

332
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,760
 you can see here it's a quite complicated graph, which is from a colleague of mine.

333
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,760
 We have the interesting bubble is in the lower left,

334
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:53,760
 which shows the offshore wind production power, which was at 2035 estimated for 3.24 GW.

335
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,760
 But this is the old grid development plan.

336
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,360
 This is everything based on.

337
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,160
 At the moment, they are re-consulting the next grid development plan, which will increase these numbers.

338
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:16,560
 So the total energy capacity was 16.4 GW for Schleswig-Holstein in conventional power.

339
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,560
 And in renewable power, we had like again 15.98 GW.

340
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,360
 So here's everything in a nice handy table.

341
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 Probably it's not that good of a read or readable.

342
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 But for 2025, we estimate a production power of 42.5 TWH.

343
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 And for 2035, we estimated 54.1 TWH of production.

344
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
 So and energy consumption is the next.

345
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,160
 We have for 2035 about 27 TWH of consumption.

346
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,760
 As you can see, we have much more energy production than consumption,

347
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,760
 which means Schleswig-Holstein, for example, is a net exporter of power,

348
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,760
 which is understandable because they have lots of wind power up there.

349
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,560
 And now comes the big problem.

350
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,360
 If you look into the power flow calculations, it's hard to see,

351
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,960
 but you can see that one of the biggest lines,

352
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,860
 so you have like two lines connecting Denmark to the south, which is simply congested.

353
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,160
 So it's too much power.

354
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,360
 And what can we do if this line is overloaded?

355
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,760
 Yeah, we need to shut off the power sources, which are the easiest to shut down.

356
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,460
 And sadly, at the moment, these are the renewables.

357
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,860
 So we are shutting down the wind power because the lines installed can't handle this.

358
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
 And it gets worse.

359
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,360
 If you look into the 2030 scenario, you can see it's getting better.

360
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,660
 It's getting worse.

361
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,460
 And in 2035, you can see it's getting even worse.

362
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,060
 So we need to shut off a lot of power, about two terawatt hours,

363
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,660
 just to be able to transport the reminder of the energy.

364
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,060
 So what I've shown here is a OPF, an optimal power flow calculation,

365
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,860
 which means I take the normal power flow I've shown you guys

366
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:23,660
 and then I try to play around with the numbers until the lines are not overloaded anymore.

367
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:28,160
 And here you can see for this one line, which was red,

368
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:36,160
 you can see several other line types, which increase the power transfer capacity.

369
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,860
 And yeah, we are at the point that even if you take the biggest line our system has available,

370
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:50,460
 you still have to shut off a big amount of power, like about 11 terawatts of power,

371
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,660
 which will cost you about 500 million euros.

372
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,660
 And that this is kind of realistic, you will see at the number below.

373
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,060
 I've taken this from the Bundesnetzagentur, the Quartalsbericht,

374
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:08,160
 and they said, yeah, about 3.8 terawatt hours.

375
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:15,460
 No, sorry, I've read the wrong number, about 500 gigawatt hours needed to be shut off,

376
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,560
 which costs about 380 million euros.

377
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:28,760
 And this is like costs we all are paying because this kind of costs will be turned over in our energy price.

378
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,160
 How does this work? If we shut down so much power in the north, we still need this power.

379
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,960
 So this power needs to come from somewhere else.

380
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,360
 So normally in the grid control operation center, they will take the phone and they will call the other power plant

381
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,460
 because our power plants are always in pairs.

382
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:56,560
 If you shut one down, you will need to increase the other power plant to get it balanced out.

383
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,160
 And this is what's happening here.

384
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,160
 And as you can see on the lower table, I've done this for the other scenarios,

385
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,760
 you will see that this is getting worse.

386
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,260
 So why am I doing this?

387
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,160
 Because I'm at the moment working on the next project.

388
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,060
 So this was NEV 4.0 and now I'm working at NRL, which is Norddeutsches Reallabor,

389
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
 which is like the follow-up project.

390
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,260
 And they're saying, okay, guys, we need to do something.

391
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,360
 So and we need to figure out what can we do.

392
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,360
 And the big idea, this is also why this is such a large project

393
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,860
 with about 60 partners from industry, science and everything,

394
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:46,360
 is we want to try out, can we use hydrogen, for example, to get this, to get a hold on this.

395
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:53,160
 So the next slide is the one I'm a bit fearsome of because as you can see here,

396
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,960
 it's the road to the future.

397
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,560
 The current grid development plan, I've looked it up the last two, three or three days

398
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,760
 because in June there was the last review of it.

399
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,560
 They say they want to increase the offshore wind power production

400
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,760
 from currently 8 gigawatts to up to 70 gigawatts in 2045.

401
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,560
 So in 20 years, we will have installed 10 times the power in wind in the North Sea.

402
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:37,060
 The PV power will increase from about 60 gigawatts to about 400 to 450 gigawatts in 2045.

403
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:43,060
 And this will cost us only for the offshore grid connection about 150 billion euros.

404
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:49,660
 So as you can imagine, this is like a really, really huge endeavor.

405
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:56,260
 And everybody's at the moment like, okay, what the hell can we do about this?

406
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,960
 Maybe some of you guys know the South Link project, which is currently in the building by Tenet.

407
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,860
 So what they are doing is from Brunspittel, which is in Schleswig-Holstein,

408
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:13,160
 they are building a DC coupling line, where completely through Germany to the southern parts.

409
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,760
 And this line has a capacity of 2 gigawatts.

410
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,960
 So for getting 70 gigawatts down to the south, we would need 35 of these South Links.

411
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,160
 And 2 gigawatts is kind of crazy amount of power.

412
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,960
 So and we need like 35 of them.

413
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,960
 So as you can see, we have much to do.

414
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,160
 And yeah, this is the part where I am sitting at the moment.

415
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,960
 So Tenet is planning at the moment to do a large scale electrolyzers.

416
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,460
 They're talking about electrolyzation in the order of gigawatts.

417
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,560
 For everybody who doesn't know what electrolyzing means, it means we take water,

418
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,960
 put energy in it and we get hydrogen.

419
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,060
 And yeah, the largest electrolyzers I've seen until now are in the megawatt scale.

420
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,460
 And they are talking about gigawatts, thousands of megawatts they want to install there.

421
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:16,660
 So and what I am doing and what we all can do is develop new algorithms to help them find suitable locations,

422
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,560
 continue the research on better strategies to increase the renewable feed in.

423
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,860
 And yeah, we are at the moment at the point to utilize AI and now everybody is like, oh now AI.

424
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:37,660
 And last but not least, we are at the moment in the middle of creating a new kind of redispatch process,

425
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:46,060
 which is not only for the high energy power plants, but also for your solar rooftop power plants.

426
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:54,760
 So that's the power companies or the power controllers are able to finely tune what's happening in the grid

427
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,260
 that we can increase the renewable feed in.

428
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,660
 And I know what you guys are thinking.

429
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,460
 Hopefully they're using a better communication strategy.

430
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:10,060
 And yeah, I can only say I'm trying my best that this will get like a modern architecture,

431
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,360
 which will not provide security problems.

432
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,360
 So thank you guys for your attention and yeah.

433
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:30,160
 Thank you so much, Mike, for giving us these insights.

434
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,660
 We have time for questions.

435
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:39,660
 Over there is an angel and you can go to the angel if you want to ask questions.

436
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:52,160
 Is there anyone or was it just so comprehensive that you understood everything

437
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,660
 and Mike has done such a great job that you all now know?

438
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,360
 Okay, someone someone is coming.

439
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,760
 You can also ask in German, so that's not a problem.

440
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,260
 I would try in English anyway.

441
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:13,760
 You would like to contact that old street map user that should be easy for any user,

442
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,260
 but just direct sending him a message.

443
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
 Okay.

444
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,960
 Yeah, I'm not not into this how this everything works.

445
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
 But yeah, maybe I'll try that.

446
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,160
 It's like he's the guy who has entered most of the power lines in Schleswig-Holstein.

447
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,660
 And I was like, okay, interesting.

448
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,260
 Who's this guy?

449
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,760
 Another just in the beginning you mentioned about resilience of the power grid and we

450
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:46,060
 saw in the war in Ukraine that it is a very critical piece of infrastructure and how well

451
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,760
 is the I think you know more about the German grid.

452
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,760
 How well suited is how resilient is that great against attacks, physical attacks?

453
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,760
 Yeah, it depends on your attack vector.

454
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
 I'd like to say so.

455
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,660
 There's several attack vectors you can imagine.

456
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,760
 The point is how large will it be your attack.

457
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:21,460
 So, for example, if you somehow manage to break into a transformer substation in your

458
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:28,460
 local area, you can possibly shut off the power for a small part, but they will fix this in

459
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
 about an hour.

460
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,460
 So, this is the normal round trip time they have to do this kind of stuff.

461
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,460
 But if your attack gets bigger and worse, for example, as you've seen, the calculations

462
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,460
 are n minus one.

463
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,960
 Sometimes they're doing n minus two.

464
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,960
 So, this means we have n components in our network and we do n times n minus one calculations

465
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:59,460
 to make sure that this system is working for every conceivable grid state.

466
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,960
 And, as you can see, this is kind of large of endeavor to do.

467
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,960
 So, you need to do a lot of calculations for this and this takes time and effort.

468
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,460
 So, maybe if you do a coordinated attack on multiple locations at the same time, you will

469
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,960
 get problems which are not that easy to handle.

470
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:31,460
 I've once been at Rotterdam where they supply London with power and they have a 1000 gigawatts.

471
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,460
 They have like a really large connection there.

472
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,460
 I'm not sure about the numbers at the moment.

473
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,460
 And, I was standing in front of such a large transformer.

474
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,960
 This was a really big one, like 300 tons, was incredibly large and they have two of them.

475
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,460
 And, there was a third one standing there.

476
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
 And, I asked the guy, "Okay, what happens if the transformer breaks?"

477
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,960
 And, he said, "Yeah, okay, basically we need to get a crane to put it over.

478
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,460
 It takes about six weeks."

479
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,960
 And, I said, "Okay, what happens if this spare unit is broken?"

480
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,460
 And, he says, "Yeah, okay, then we need to order a new one.

481
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,960
 It takes five years."

482
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,460
 And, I was like, "Hmm, okay."

483
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,460
 So, and basically the security is like a fence.

484
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,960
 And, what we've seen already in the grid, in the European grid,

485
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,960
 the European power grid is interconnected and all of the transmission system operators are working together.

486
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,460
 They have also communications protocols to exchange data about what's the grid state in my area and so on.

487
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,460
 And, this is all interconnected.

488
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,460
 And, what we can see is there was once an effect where you have some kind of disturbance in Poland, for example,

489
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,960
 which creates like a big scale wave over all of Europe,

490
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,460
 which you could see as a big voltage fluctuation in Spain.

491
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,460
 So, effects are happening.

492
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,460
 That's why we are building components which allow to adjust the power flow.

493
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,460
 So, normally electrical energy is like the worst good you can have,

494
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,460
 because you need to produce exactly the same amount you use.

495
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,960
 Otherwise, your power system will get out of hand.

496
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,460
 You can see this at the frequency of your power.

497
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,460
 50.0 Hertz is like perfect.

498
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:25,960
 And, if you differ by only, I think, 20 millihertz, you have like huge amounts of too much or too less generation.

499
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:33,460
 So, maybe there was a sun out, because a...

500
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,460
 Now, the words are missing.

501
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,460
 Solar eclipse. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

502
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,460
 There was a solar eclipse, and Tenet and the other transmission system operators

503
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,460
 asked us to do studies what will happen in the whole European grid,

504
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,460
 because the sun will be out for like, I don't know, five minutes or so.

505
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,460
 And, we looked into it and tried to figure out how big of an effect will this have.

506
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,460
 So, it was noticeable, but, yeah, they managed to get around it.

507
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:11,460
 So, yeah, depends on the effect size or the attack vector.

508
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,460
 We're going to take this question, and then we are going to close the Q&A.

509
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:26,460
 Okay, so basically my question was, you mentioned in the ending that we can use hydrogen, kind of solve all this.

510
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,460
 And I would like to get some scale estimations, like how expensive and big would a fuel cell be to do like,

511
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,460
 that's to the two gigawatts you were saying about the line,

512
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:46,460
 and also what kind of volumes would need to be transported of hydrogen to like have an equivalent to such a line

513
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
 and transport the energy like that.

514
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,460
 So, the project is at the moment at the beginning,

515
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,460
 and this is the revision of the grid development plan from a month ago.

516
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,460
 So, we are still in the process of figuring it out.

517
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,460
 And, to be honest, I can't tell you.

518
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:10,460
 So, I know some numbers for some electrolyzers, but not at that large kind of scale.

519
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:16,460
 Like I said, I know for megawatts of electrolyzers, but not of gigawatts of electrolyzers.

520
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,460
 And the next problem is the infrastructure.

521
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,460
 Not only the power, which needs like large power connections, you also need water.

522
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:31,460
 So, this is like the biggest problematic factor for electrolyzers is to get water, which you can electrolyze.

523
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,460
 If you think about, you don't need much water for electrolyzers,

524
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:43,460
 but if you want to turn a gigawatt worth of power over, you will need a lot of water simply.

525
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,460
 And salt water is not that good to use.

526
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:54,460
 So, TANET is at the moment discussing to not transport the energy from the offshore wind power plants to the shore,

527
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:02,460
 but to turn it over into hydrogen directly in the offshore region, so that they produce hydrogen offshore.

528
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,460
 And this means you need to first desalinate the water and then to turn it over.

529
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,460
 And this is like probably giving you an idea how big this is.

530
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,460
 So, the next problem is how do we transport the hydrogen to somewhere else?

531
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,460
 Because if you have hydrogen, you need to get it away.

532
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:33,460
 At the first stages of the project, they discussed, and I was quite shocked, to just put it on a semi-truck and drive it around.

533
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,460
 It was like, okay, interesting.

534
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,460
 So, basically if your semi-truck runs on hydrogen, yeah, but no.

535
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:53,460
 And the next problem is your gas infrastructure, which you can by the way calculate with PANAPIPS, needs to be suited for hydrogen.

536
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:00,460
 So, maybe you guys know that you can feed in hydrogen in the normal gas infrastructure,

537
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:08,460
 but this depends on so many factors that studies are estimating wild, wild, wild values.

538
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:17,460
 Some studies say you can feed in like less than 2% of hydrogen, and other studies suggest that you can feed in about 30%.

539
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,460
 So, one way they're doing it at the moment, they're putting liners into the pipe.

540
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:33,460
 So, this is like a big plastic snake, which is snaking through the line, and then you have like a plastic coating on the inside, which allows to transport hydrogen.

541
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:40,460
 It's the smallest molecule we have, and it will just diffuse through steel. So, it just disappears, it dissipates.

542
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:54,460
 And yeah, if you're losing like, I don't know, 10 to 20% just through the process of transporting, it's not that beneficial.

543
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,460
 Good. So, thank you so much, Mike.

544
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:03,460
 If you have any more questions to him, you can, of course, just talk to him at the side of the tent.

545
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:12,460
 Our next talk here is going to be "Hack My Handicap" in a quarter at 11 a.m.

546
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:24,460
 So, I hope to see you all there and stay hydrated. Please give a round of applause to Mike for his applause.

547
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,460
 Thank you, guys.
