 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:33,680
 So welcome our next speaker, Equinox.

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,040
 Just take it away.

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,520
 Yeah.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,320
 Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,320
 I'm Equinox.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
 If you've looked at the Farplans, their schedule,

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,920
 this is unfortunately a little bit of a rescue effort

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,800
 because I had a hardware problem yesterday,

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,760
 so I had to recreate the entire presentation.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
 I apologize ahead of time for this being a little bit less

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,680
 polished than I would have liked it to be.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,640
 So let's start with a quick outline of what

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,600
 I want to talk about here.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,960
 I hope you did look at the talk description.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,160
 If you don't know where you are, then maybe go figure that out.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:19,320
 This is mostly about how to do HF design without knowing

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,840
 how to do HF design.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,520
 It's a bit of an experience report from having it done.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
 I'm first going to give some general framing so you

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,880
 know what the goal is, what the target is.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,760
 I'm going to go talk a little bit about why this is generally

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,240
 something people don't like doing, why it's hard,

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,200
 how I ended up doing it without having the proper tools for it,

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,280
 what the result was, and then there's

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,080
 some room for general things about this thing.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,400
 I am a software person.

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,960
 I don't build hardware as a job.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,320
 I never learned how to build hardware.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,960
 I pick up things.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,200
 If you talk to someone who knows how to do HF design,

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,920
 raise your hand if you actually know how to do HF design with--

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,440
 oh, there's someone here in the video team.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,000
 One more.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
 You will be incredibly bored, and if you

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,400
 see me saying something that is wrong,

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,360
 feel free to correct me.

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 OK.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,640
 Also, if you talk to someone afterwards and they tell you,

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
 I said something that was completely wrong, that

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,000
 is very easily possible.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,560
 This got started as a project from the CCZ NOC

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,280
 from running event networks.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,560
 If you have been around for 29C3 till 33C3

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
 when we were in Hamburg, the building

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,800
 has a lot of shitty fiber, and yeah, it wasn't great.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,040
 And to deal with that, the idea was

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,200
 to go look at maybe making some tool for helping with that.

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
 In the particular case of the CCH,

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,480
 the problem is actually dispersion,

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,240
 which if you have multimode fiber,

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
 the signal has multiple modes.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,960
 That's the definition of a multimode fiber that it can take,

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,880
 and those have different speeds, so the signal

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
 gets mushy kind of.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,700
 I don't have an installation of this,

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,080
 but we can talk about this later in the talk.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,040
 It's going to come up again.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,240
 So the idea was born to make a kind of a fiber

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,400
 tool for building networks, for debugging networks,

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,960
 originally just to extend connections in the CCH

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,400
 when we were range limited.

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,120
 This kind of evolved into a more generic multi-tool later.

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 If you work with network equipment and home-built tools

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,840
 in this area, you may know that there

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,040
 are some PCBs that connect to fiber transceivers just

67
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
 directly to each other.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,360
 This was not the goal here.

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,400
 The goal was to have an active repeater.

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,840
 I'm noticing a few confused faces.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,600
 I think I will go a little bit further in explaining

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,840
 what the goal here is.

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,620
 I didn't include slides for this.

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,000
 Actually, the next slide is good for this.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,280
 This is the prototype of this project.

76
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,120
 What you can see on the left, those two metal cages

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,120
 with numbers 1 and 2, those are slots

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,920
 for optical transceivers for running network over fiber.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,440
 You put a module into that that matches the infrastructure

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
 that you need for your network.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
 That might be a multimode transceiver, a single mode

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
 transceiver, a single mode transceiver with very long

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,400
 range, depending on what your cabling is.

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,640
 If you have an intercontinental fiber going through the ocean,

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,480
 you may want to use a very long range transceiver

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,680
 and some amplifiers in the middle.

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,800
 It's made into separate modules so you

88
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,080
 can adapt to the situation that you have at hand.

89
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
 You use the transceiver that you need.

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,640
 Those run at 1 gigabit, 10 gigabit, 25 gigabit, soon,

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
 even more.

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,440
 25 is the current limit for this form factor.

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,240
 But this talk is about 10 gigabit ethernet mostly,

94
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,080
 which was current at the time that I started this project.

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,880
 This thing has--

96
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,560
 I've built it like four years ago.

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,240
 It was just an attempt at getting something going.

98
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,880
 You can see there is a small little chip immediately

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,680
 to the right of those two slots.

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,360
 And that is an active electrical repeater.

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,000
 Let's go back to the previous slide for a little bit.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,320
 You can frequently find these boards

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,640
 without that chip in there, which means the two transceivers

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,520
 that you have for converting your fiber signal into the

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,640
 interface that your system needs,

106
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,080
 they are just connected back to back to each other.

107
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,400
 So the output from one goes into the input from another.

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,920
 That, in this case, was specifically a requirement

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
 that this is not enough.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,160
 Because in a situation like in Hamburg with the building

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,560
 with the shitty fibers, you get a shitty signal

112
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
 and just retransmitting this shitty signal

113
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
 is not going to help you.

114
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,880
 So I hope I collected some more people

115
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
 to see where this is going.

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,000
 As I said, this is the first prototype.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
 It did actually work.

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,040
 This is the current version.

119
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,520
 The slide is mostly here, so you know what I'm actually

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,120
 talking about in the next slides.

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,480
 The actual problem here is there's a lot of high speed

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,360
 signals, four in this case, coming from four receivers.

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,800
 And you need to deal with those.

124
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,240
 And dealing with, in this case, five gigahertz

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,760
 of an electrical signal is not a lot of fun.

126
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,280
 So let's get into the actual topic of this presentation.

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,960
 It's not easy to do these designs.

128
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,040
 The handbook for this, this is one of the references

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,520
 that people point at when you try to get

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,440
 started in this general area.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,880
 It's literally called the Handbook of Black Magic.

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,440
 And it is appropriately called that.

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,840
 As soon as your signals start to get a little bit faster,

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,440
 you don't actually have rectangular waveforms anymore

135
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,160
 for your signals.

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,720
 Everything starts to get mushy.

137
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,800
 And this is the first recommendation, basically,

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,400
 that I have buried in this talk.

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,560
 This book is still relevant.

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,400
 The physics doesn't really change.

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,240
 The chips have gotten a lot better.

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,960
 And there is, basically, with chips getting better,

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,320
 they also get better at dealing with 3D signals.

144
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,240
 They get better at outputting clean signals.

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
 So you can just multiply everything in this book

146
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,200
 by some factor.

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
 And it still applies.

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,920
 It's just, if this book says something about 10 megahertz,

149
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,440
 it might now apply for a higher frequency in some cases,

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,880
 because the silicon has just gotten better.

151
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,600
 This doesn't apply everywhere, but it applies somewhere.

152
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,760
 This book is also great to get started

153
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,320
 to understand what you don't understand.

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,280
 So coming from a position of knowing exactly nothing

155
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,640
 about this, this book for me was a good point of entry

156
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,040
 to figure out, oh, this will be a problem.

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,120
 That will be a problem.

158
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
 That will be a problem.

159
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,560
 Let's look at actual high frequency electronics

160
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,600
 and considerations in this area.

161
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,640
 You start from your naive assumption

162
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,160
 of having an ideal cable, which is just a wire.

163
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,800
 That works, I don't know, maybe to the megahertz range.

164
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,720
 I think even in the higher megahertz range,

165
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
 you get problems with this.

166
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,920
 When you start getting problems, you

167
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,320
 start considering the cable as a sequence of parasitic elements.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,440
 They're called parasitic because they're not

169
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,920
 intended to be there.

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,200
 So what you see at the bottom here is just a model

171
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,800
 of what you treat the cable like.

172
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,480
 Suddenly you have capacitance, you have resistance,

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,040
 you have inductive elements.

174
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,480
 The cable isn't built like this.

175
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,120
 This is just a model of understanding

176
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
 what the cable does.

177
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,840
 But this is only the first level.

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,560
 As soon as you start going into even higher frequencies,

179
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,720
 in this case, this is a vertical cut simulated

180
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,840
 through a printed circuit board with two signals.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,640
 And you can see on the right-hand side

182
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,940
 is the energy distribution of the signal

183
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,000
 being propagated along the trace on the PCB.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,860
 And you can see it's not actually uniform in the trace

185
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,360
 anymore.

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
 The trace is black.

187
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,600
 All the energy is flowing on the outside of the trace.

188
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,360
 So you really can't consider a wire or trace a wire anymore.

189
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,080
 It behaves in odd ways.

190
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,000
 When you go to higher frequencies again,

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,080
 you should be simulating your design

192
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,800
 in some software that just takes a 3D model of your entire

193
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,720
 printed circuit board and divides it into very tiny elements

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
 and just calculates Maxwell's equations

195
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,280
 for every single element.

196
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,800
 And by doing that, you can get a better impression

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
 of what your printed circuit board actually

198
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,880
 behaves like when you put a signal on it.

199
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,640
 This currently-- I'm not sure how far the key cut support

200
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,080
 for this has come.

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,760
 When I started the project, there

202
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,540
 was no open source implementation of this

203
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,320
 that was really usable.

204
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,880
 So I didn't really want to buy a software license for something

205
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 like this, which would have cost, I don't know, a few thousand

206
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,380
 euros.

207
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,500
 I didn't know people at the time who had the license,

208
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,920
 so I just didn't do this, which is kind of, again,

209
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,840
 the topic of the talk.

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,760
 How do you do this without the proper tools?

211
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,120
 And even worse, the simulation is not even

212
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,560
 going to tell you what the actual result is from making

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,520
 your printed circuit board.

214
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,560
 At these frequencies, you start getting problems

215
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,720
 with having corners in your traces where things are just

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,440
 getting reflected.

217
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,000
 Making your trace on the PCB wider or smaller

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,400
 can cause reflections, can cause loss.

219
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
 Having wires going through the board starts becoming a problem.

220
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 So at some point, when you go high enough

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,320
 in the frequencies and the data rates that you want to handle,

222
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,080
 you really need to build the boards, measure them,

223
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,480
 take the feedback into account, build them again.

224
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,400
 As with before, I didn't do this.

225
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,160
 The lab gear for this is seriously expensive.

226
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,280
 Even renting it is very expensive.

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,920
 I could have shipped it out to some people to measure it.

228
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,760
 I did, in fact, ask for that.

229
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,040
 And people said, yeah, I will measure it for you.

230
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,640
 Unfortunately, I didn't do it.

231
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,080
 So the end result is what I call design by angst.

232
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,280
 So all I could do was basically read as much as I could find,

233
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,760
 read the application notes for the chips I'm using,

234
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,000
 try to be as careful as possible, and use the tools

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,880
 that I have available.

236
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,640
 So if I go back to these--

237
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
 what's the English word?--

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,920
 cuts through the PCBs, those are for the actual PCB

239
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,400
 that I ended up building.

240
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,280
 And they seem to be not too far off.

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,920
 And funnily enough, this is a very, very tool

242
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,360
 from a PCB suite that has been discontinued.

243
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
 It says at the bottom it's called AlterPCB_TLINE_SIM.

244
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,480
 If anyone wants to play around with that,

245
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,800
 you can still find the code by digging around on GitHub.

246
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
 You need to build it yourself.

247
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,680
 It's a very odd tool.

248
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
 But this was the limit of tools I had access to at the time.

249
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:22,160
 This is basically what ended up being my result from just

250
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,440
 trying to, I guess, bullshit my way through the design.

251
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,360
 So you can see on the top there is

252
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
 the four ports for the transceivers

253
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
 that I mentioned before.

254
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:44,040
 I've drawn in what I could remember in precautions to take.

255
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,560
 Some are kind of self-explanatory.

256
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,440
 I did try to length match the differential pairs.

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,000
 That's the circle thing on the bottom left.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,880
 Some application notes nowadays say

259
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,440
 that you shouldn't do this, which I didn't understand.

260
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,680
 So I just kept doing it.

261
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,120
 I did keep distance between the differential pairs,

262
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,080
 which is something every data sheet tells you to do.

263
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,400
 There's something called the 3W rule, or even the 5W rule,

264
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,360
 which says that whatever the distance between your pairs

265
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,520
 is, you should have three times or five times that distance

266
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,360
 as free area to your other traces.

267
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,640
 I did make this design by keeping everything

268
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,480
 as short as I could, which then people also

269
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,080
 told me that that might not be a good idea, because if you

270
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,480
 have a short line, it's basically less attenuation

271
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,840
 for any reflections that you may have.

272
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,240
 So if your signal starts going back and forth,

273
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,000
 which it can very much do at these frequencies,

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,480
 if it's a longer trace, it will get attenuated on the way back

275
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
 and then attenuated again, so your reflections die down.

276
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,000
 And this doesn't happen as much if you have a shorter trace.

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,400
 I went with this.

278
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,800
 I also used anti-pads, which is just

279
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,160
 punching a hole in the ground plane that

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
 is under the connector in this case,

281
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,280
 because the connector has a much larger area on the printed

282
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,440
 circuit board where the connector needs to be soldered onto.

283
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,000
 And that doesn't match the behavior of the other traces

284
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,800
 on your board.

285
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
 So what you do is you cut a hole in the ground plane,

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,320
 and that kind of compensates for that.

287
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,840
 There are some things you can't see in the diagram.

288
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,680
 You always have to have a continuous ground

289
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,480
 with all of these things.

290
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,840
 And that ground plane needs to be directly

291
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,960
 below your high-speed traces.

292
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,200
 Or if the high-speed traces are inside of the board,

293
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,760
 you need to sandwich it in power supply planes.

294
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,840
 You need to have decoupling for the chips you use.

295
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,800
 Using wires makes things really hard.

296
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,400
 So you can see I was able to get away

297
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,560
 without using any wires, which probably--

298
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,880
 if I had to use wires to go to the other side of the board,

299
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,800
 then I'm guessing that this probably would not have worked.

300
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,400
 So yeah, the layout in this case worked out.

301
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,840
 To be fair, most chips in this area for high-speed signals

302
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,560
 are designed to make the layout as easy as possible.

303
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,120
 I did also invert the polarity on some of the traces here,

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,400
 reversing plus and minus basically

305
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,360
 inside of the differential pair.

306
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,900
 The chips have a bit in the output

307
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,080
 that you can set that just reverses that,

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,520
 and you just need to set the bit correctly to change it back.

309
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,640
 So the whole point of this talk is, did this work?

310
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,480
 If you know HF, then you can understand it's a yes.

311
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,560
 If you don't know HF, I will explain shortly

312
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,960
 what these pictures mean.

313
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,640
 However, if you understand HF, you also

314
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,840
 mean that it didn't quite work.

315
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,280
 So I can hear a few laughs.

316
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,760
 All of these are eye diagrams.

317
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,880
 What an eye diagram is is from your high-speed signal,

318
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,040
 in this case, 10 gigabit ethernet.

319
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,200
 You take one clock period and just keep

320
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,760
 stacking it on top of itself.

321
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,240
 So looking at these diagrams, you

322
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,520
 have the signal going from a 1 to a 1 to a 1,

323
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,920
 from a 1 to a 1 to a 0 or something,

324
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,880
 or from a 0 to a 1 to a 0.

325
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
 That creates these curves, basically.

326
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,880
 And the horizontal is one period of the signal.

327
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,280
 And you just stack it and stack it.

328
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
 And five of these look good.

329
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,280
 The sixth one in the bottom is actually still OK,

330
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,080
 but much worse than the other ones.

331
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,120
 The good thing in this case is that the chip I'm using

332
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,880
 has a built-in monitor for generating these things,

333
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,480
 because otherwise, I would need the expensive test equipment,

334
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
 again, to even get this debugging information.

335
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,360
 So that's also something to point out as part of this.

336
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,480
 If you try to build high-speed electronics like this,

337
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,320
 absolutely pay attention to the debugging

338
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,760
 tools the chips give you.

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,440
 Something I saw in more expensive other chips

340
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,160
 was that they have a built-in error rate tester, which

341
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,440
 this one doesn't.

342
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,760
 So I wasn't yet able to run a bit error rate test.

343
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
 I'm trying to find ways to do that.

344
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,320
 But yeah, having this eye diagram monitor, it's a lifesaver.

345
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,560
 Now, for that middle-bottom diagram,

346
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
 that's where you really hit the limitations

347
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,360
 of building something like this without the proper tools.

348
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
 Essentially, I have no way to figure out

349
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,800
 why that one connection is worse than the others.

350
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,120
 It's probably still workable, but I'm not

351
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
 comfortable with seeing that and knowing

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,440
 that five of my connections are OK,

353
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,200
 and the sixth one is somehow weird.

354
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
 I was lucky in this case.

355
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,560
 Well, lucky is maybe the wrong word.

356
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,040
 I did just forget the AC coupling capacitors

357
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,520
 on that connection.

358
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,120
 The HF guys may laugh at me for this.

359
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,360
 For everyone else, I may need to explain how many people don't

360
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,800
 know what AC coupling is.

361
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,320
 That's enough.

362
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,000
 So for a signal like this--

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
 let's go back to maybe this--

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,240
 those two wires each are one signal,

365
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,760
 and one wire goes in the positive direction,

366
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,960
 the other goes to the negative direction.

367
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,480
 And they go around a center point, basically.

368
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,640
 And that is a DC component that just stays constant.

369
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,760
 However, your receiver may have a requirement

370
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,720
 for some specific midpoint voltage, which

371
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
 means that you need to put a capacitor in the middle

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,360
 so your receiver can shift the signal somewhere

373
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,200
 where it likes to receive it.

374
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,480
 And these ships have that requirement.

375
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
 And the optical transceivers have this built in,

376
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,560
 except I have some connections between the chips

377
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,520
 where I completely forgot this.

378
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,160
 So I'm hoping that I can get away without debugging

379
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,640
 and just fix this.

380
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,880
 For the record, I noticed this yesterday.

381
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,920
 So oops.

382
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,020
 It does actually work, though, which is kind of funny.

383
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,480
 It hopefully is also the reason that this stuff is

384
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,280
 getting hot as shit, because if you have some difference

385
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,240
 in the DC levels between the two chips,

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,240
 the sender might be outputting 1.6 volt common mode.

387
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,680
 And the receiver might be trying to pull down

388
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,080
 to 1.2 volt common mode.

389
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
 And you have just 0.4 volts being

390
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,080
 lost somewhere in the middle.

391
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,660
 And that would explain why the ships are getting so hot.

392
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,720
 I don't really have the stuff with me

393
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,440
 to try and fix this here.

394
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,040
 So I'll have to go back and try and debug this.

395
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,700
 The other takeaway here is at some point,

396
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,360
 you need to ask for help.

397
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,080
 I did ask both RF guy and Andrew Zonberg for help.

398
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,960
 And they both--

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,280
 RF guy already was very helpful, gave me a lot of feedback.

400
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,280
 Andrew, I asked for actually help in simulating this.

401
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,320
 I got this lost on my end and never sent him design.

402
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,240
 But the point of this talk, I guess,

403
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,620
 is it is, in fact, possible to build things like this.

404
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,000
 You need to be extremely careful about the tools you use.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,640
 In this case, the chip has a lot of built-in debugging features.

406
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,920
 So yeah.

407
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,800
 I kind of sprinted through my presentation.

408
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,320
 I expected this to take 30 minutes.

409
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,040
 It took 20 at best.

410
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,400
 So I think there is a lot of room for questions.

411
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,640
 I also have additional stories about building

412
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,000
 this from parts that are not directly HF stuff.

413
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,520
 I had those in the presentation, and I lost it on a broken

414
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,200
 laptop.

415
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,720
 I'm very sorry about that.

416
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,840
 I have backups.

417
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,200
 They are three months old.

418
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,920
 [LAUGHTER]

419
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,640
 Oops.

420
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,120
 OK.

421
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,320
 Let's try maybe to get started.

422
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,840
 Does anyone have basic questions where I should just

423
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,520
 explain some more?

424
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,000
 Just quickly, before we get to the questions, maybe a big

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,480
 round of applause for Equinox.

426
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,040
 [APPLAUSE]

427
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,800
 And if you have questions, the mic row--

428
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,920
 or there will be a queue there for questions.

429
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,200
 So go to the mic over there with the mic.

430
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,080
 Yeah.

431
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,360
 So thank you for the talk.

432
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,440
 Great talk.

433
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,960
 I've done a bit of HF in the past.

434
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,160
 I would expect that going to 25 gigabits would be orders of

435
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,480
 magnitude harder.

436
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,560
 Do you think it would be possible to do it by hand like

437
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,800
 you mostly did?

438
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:26,760
 OK, for context, going to 25 gigabit is not--

439
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,440
 there's some exponential scaling involved, which just

440
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,920
 makes things extremely harder.

441
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,960
 And I don't have the knowledge to answer your question.

442
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,680
 So people have asked me if it's possible to build something

443
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,840
 like this for 25 gigabit, especially because 4 times 25

444
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
 is 100 gigabit link.

445
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 There are some chips around that I would

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
 like to use for this.

447
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,240
 The reason I haven't done it yet is--

448
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,480
 and this is actually an important thing of this talk

449
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,520
 that I wanted to do--

450
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,800
 I want to give a kind of a negative shout out to one of

451
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,560
 the vendors, in this case, Macom.

452
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
 They have the perfect chip for this, but they don't give you

453
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,600
 access to the data sheet.

454
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,200
 You can find it by Googling, but it's only a basic sheet.

455
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,080
 The chip is perfect for building something like this,

456
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,520
 but they are extremely dismissive if you try to contact

457
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,480
 them and try to get more information.

458
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,120
 I may have another talk in two years, three years, about what

459
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,200
 the story was with 25 gig, if it worked out.

460
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,360
 Since at this point, KiCad is getting the support for--

461
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,240
 I'm losing the microphone, sorry.

462
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,480
 So since KiCad is getting the support for simulating the

463
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,000
 boards, I would hope that this is sufficient to stretch the

464
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,320
 possible some more, basically.

465
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,560
 Sorry.

466
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,760
 I honestly don't know.

467
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
 I'm the person who is telling how far I was able to get

468
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,760
 without knowing how it works.

469
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,200
 We may need to find--

470
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,240
 there were some people who raised their hands about being

471
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,040
 HF engineers.

472
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,120
 If someone else wants to throw in their two cents, I'd be

473
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,360
 happy to hear.

474
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,280
 And the next question?

475
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,920
 Great talk, and you're a hero for attending this.

476
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,080
 You had this really cool thing about the monitor of the chip

477
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,160
 being used to give you the eye diagram.

478
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,920
 Did you try to maybe do it with your own test equipment, to

479
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,200
 hack the chip and just measure other devices' eye diagrams?

480
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:37,400
 The chip has a built-in eye monitor.

481
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,640
 However, the chip only works for certain ranges of signal.

482
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
 It's a lot that it works for.

483
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,440
 So the chip has a range of either 8 to 10 point something

484
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,280
 or 9 to 12 point something gigabaud.

485
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,960
 And it can divide that by 1, 2, 4, or 8.

486
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,800
 So it works in kind of some areas.

487
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,920
 You could connect that to get a rudimentary eye monitor.

488
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,160
 I haven't thought about making my own test tool.

489
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:13,080
 I was hoping that maybe someone would build an open

490
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,000
 source VNA, which is the right tool for this.

491
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,840
 It might also be possible to use, if you know, the nano VNA.

492
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,680
 That's single-ended, but if you combine it with a balloon, it

493
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,160
 might be possible to do differential measurements.

494
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,760
 Again, so I don't feel comfortable building a test

495
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,920
 tool myself with the limited understanding I have.

496
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,600
 I feel like I can build an application, but I can't build

497
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,640
 an actual measurement device.

498
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,960
 Because if you build a measurement device, you should

499
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,200
 know what you're doing.

500
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,960
 You know?

501
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,640
 That's my--

502
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,040
 Oh.

503
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,680
 Yeah, sure.

504
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,880
 So for a proper test equipment, yeah, sure.

505
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,040
 But just for hacking around, if you just have some sort of

506
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,400
 breakout board to do this--

507
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,240
 I wasn't even aware that these chips can do that.

508
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
 So this is really cool.

509
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,200
 You can take a copper direct attach cable and

510
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,080
 just cut it open.

511
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,320
 That should work if you have the right signal levels.

512
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,880
 However, the signal levels are mostly the same anyway for all

513
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
 of the high-speed stuff.

514
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,720
 So that shouldn't be a problem, I would hope.

515
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,320
 Yeah.

516
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,280
 And then we have the next man.

517
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,520
 So you said your motivation was like the faulty cables in

518
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,760
 the CCH, but the CCH tear down and now rebuild.

519
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,680
 Do you see any other cool stuff you can do?

520
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,440
 They still have the same shitty fibers, unfortunately.

521
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,680
 So if we go back to Hamburg, I'm not sure they have the

522
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,120
 exact same type.

523
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,600
 I do know that they still have multimode fiber.

524
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,960
 And oh, I did mention that I wanted to go into a little bit

525
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,200
 more detail why multimode fiber is a problem.

526
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:03,640
 So normally, when the signal gets weaker, on the optical

527
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,000
 signal-- this is the electrical signal, to be clear.

528
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,480
 On the optical signal, you just get a closer and closer eye,

529
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,800
 and at some point, the receiver doesn't work anymore.

530
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,200
 With the shitty multimode fiber, you get horizontal eye

531
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,280
 closure, because the signals take different paths, and they

532
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,000
 get mushier and mushier on the time domain.

533
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,360
 So the horizontal is the time on this.

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,240
 I'm not sure if the CCH still has multimode fiber that is as

535
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,520
 bad as it was before.

536
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,160
 I only know that they put back multimode fiber in general.

537
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,240
 I would hope that they did maybe replace it.

538
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,880
 But yeah.

539
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,920
 So if we go back to Hamburg, which seems likely, we may

540
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,080
 want to use those again.

541
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,680
 I don't know.

542
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,720
 Maybe.

543
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,520
 Apart from that, it is intended as a general fiber tool.

544
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,800
 It does have batteries.

545
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,640
 It's pocket-sized.

546
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,560
 You can just put transceivers into it and use it as a helper

547
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,840
 while you roll out your network.

548
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,120
 We did have multiple occurrences at buildup during

549
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,320
 camp where this would have been useful.

550
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,600
 Unfortunately, this is not quite ready.

551
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,720
 The hardware works.

552
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,040
 I've connected my laptop to the internet through this at

553
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
 10 gig.

554
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,600
 So I know it works, except the software still needs to be

555
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 done.

556
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,560
 Right now, I need to do I2C register writes to set it up

557
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
 correctly.

558
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,840
 And it wasn't quite ready, because I ran out of time in

559
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
 the run-up to the camp.

560
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,640
 So yeah.

561
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
 I think it's useful as a tool.

562
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,280
 Sorry, next question.

563
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,160
 Yeah, hi.

564
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,480
 Thanks for your talk and your nice project.

565
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,800
 Following up on the 25 gig, you are lucky.

566
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,400
 You go to optical transceivers, to SME converters.

567
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
 Traces are all short.

568
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,920
 It's completely different when you do a layout that actually

569
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,800
 goes then to 100 meter copper.

570
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,360
 So this helps in your case.

571
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
 Your proper job in analyzing and being very careful,

572
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
 reading all the stuff, you do the same for 25 gig.

573
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,080
 Probably you have to switch away from FR4 space material

574
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,840
 to get more RF ready.

575
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,120
 But it's doable.

576
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,440
 You can still do it with KiCAD and analyze, with other

577
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,880
 FEM tools, which are open source around.

578
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,960
 It's just more work.

579
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,480
 And you need to select properly your PCB when on all the

580
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,200
 impedance control, which just costs more money.

581
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,640
 Possibly this is going to the more debug features, as you

582
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,160
 said, your chip has a built-in eye monitor, but for very

583
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
 limited frequencies.

584
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
 And you don't have the bit error rate tester.

585
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,320
 If you are interested in doing debugging with these kind of

586
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,640
 features, go for FPGA development boards, which have

587
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,800
 SFP modules.

588
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,200
 Then you don't have open source tools.

589
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
 Then you just install the tool chain from the render.

590
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,360
 From there you have eye belt or smart belt features inside

591
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,200
 the transceivers of the FPGAs by a development kit with a

592
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,120
 proper layout and done and connected to here.

593
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 And then you can still do loopback tests and get all

594
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,440
 your features done.

595
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,560
 I think this is a really long question.

596
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,480
 But you have to finally the question.

597
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,360
 OK.

598
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,080
 There are some FPGAs where I think you can, in fact, also

599
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,120
 get an eye diagram from the debug software.

600
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
 Like, yeah, OK.

601
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,200
 I know these features exist.

602
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,720
 So if other people want to know more about this, I guess

603
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,120
 they can come to you.

604
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
 And yeah, the vendors certainly know how to make

605
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,000
 their boards for their dev kits, because they want to

606
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
 sell their hardware.

607
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,720
 Next question.

608
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,040
 Maybe just one very short question.

609
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,720
 Did you try talking about the VNA stuff?

610
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,040
 Did you try this in VNA front end, IC from analog, ADL,

611
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,000
 5960?

612
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,760
 I have become aware that it exists.

613
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,720
 I haven't looked at any of the details yet.

614
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,400
 It's the same comment as before.

615
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'm not sure I have enough knowledge to look at measuring

616
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,280
 equipment, because that analog device ship is really

617
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 targeted at building a VNA.

618
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,400
 And I feel like I don't have enough knowledge to do that.

619
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,200
 I would hope that in general, someone will build an open

620
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,920
 source tool like that.

621
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,600
 Maybe the nano VNA people will just make, I think, version

622
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,560
 6's next one.

623
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,640
 But that would be very cool.

624
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,040
 Oh, I did forget a comment to the previous--

625
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,840
 this is also manufactured by GLCPCB, which is cheap

626
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,680
 Chinese PCBs.

627
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,920
 So that's another comment on the feasibility of this.

628
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,240
 With 10 gig, you can get away with using cheap, mostly

629
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,760
 specified PCBs.

630
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,880
 The funny thing is that GLCPCB changed their specification

631
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 of their layer stack ups midway through me building this,

632
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,160
 which is not nice either.

633
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,600
 But this is certainly not precision PCBs.

634
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,920
 This is just a cheap four layer board, which also four layer

635
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,720
 boards are just cheap enough these days.

636
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
 Don't even try to do this with a two layer board.

637
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,080
 It's not going to work, I'm pretty sure.

638
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,320
 Next question.

639
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,800
 Yeah.

640
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,560
 I think this is probably the last question.

641
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,360
 And then if people want to find you after this to talk to you,

642
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,080
 where can they find you?

643
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,280
 You can find me in the knock.

644
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,680
 I do have 10 more minutes, right?

645
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,760
 Yeah, you have 10 more minutes.

646
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,240
 Yeah.

647
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,880
 Also, you can--

648
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,760
 I think we can just fill with questions, right?

649
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,920
 I mean, there seems to be one in queue, so.

650
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,960
 Yeah, I just have a short comment about something you

651
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,160
 just said.

652
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,880
 You said that the FPGA vendors know how to build their

653
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,920
 dev boards because they want to sell them.

654
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,160
 Don't count on it.

655
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

656
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,760
 OK.

657
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,640
 OK.

658
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
 Sure.

659
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,520
 Well, switch vendors don't know how to build switches either.

660
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,760
 I can tell you from experience.

661
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,960
 Yeah.

662
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,080
 Yeah.

663
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,600
 Considering that I have 10 minutes left, I can't just go

664
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
 into random other stuff.

665
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
 Because-- oh, sorry.

666
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,080
 There's one more.

667
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,520
 Yeah, so you asked for comments from other people

668
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,120
 who had experience doing this sort of thing.

669
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,040
 I did a HDMI matrix switch.

670
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,840
 And then a display port matrix switch.

671
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,240
 And had very similar experiences to yours, except

672
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,720
 mostly things just work.

673
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,000
 Yeah.

674
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,680
 And I think it's to do with receiver quality.

675
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,760
 Yeah.

676
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,640
 Did you have some measurement that you could do to get some

677
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,160
 eye diagram or just some measure of whether you were

678
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,960
 barely working or working well?

679
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,280
 So I did actually do oscilloscope measurements at

680
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,640
 low frequencies, which told me something.

681
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 And then I sent the board to Andrew, which

682
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,120
 told me a lot more.

683
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:11,680
 There is actually an HDMI re-timer chip, which can do eye

684
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,600
 diagrams.

685
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,440
 But it's out of stock.

686
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,840
 But once it's back in stock, I'm also planning to make

687
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,800
 measurements go like this.

688
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,960
 Yeah.

689
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,240
 This thing got delayed by two years as well, because the

690
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,560
 microcontroller was just not available, and other chips were

691
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,400
 just not available.

692
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,320
 And yeah, luckily that has mostly come to an end.

693
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,280
 If people are still interested, there's actually

694
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
 two boards in this.

695
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,520
 And as it turns out, most of the problems in building this

696
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,680
 actually came from the power supply and building an

697
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,640
 overcomplicated environment around all of the HF stuff.

698
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
 I tried to build this as power-savvy as possible, which

699
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,200
 caused more problems.

700
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,320
 It has battery charging, which has caused problems.

701
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,080
 So I think the closing sentence here is maybe try

702
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,920
 one thing first.

703
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,280
 The HF stuff can definitely be done.

704
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,720
 And don't forget the other stuff.

705
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,800
 If I had been a bit more careful, I think I could have

706
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
 saved myself quite a few revisions.

707
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,800
 I think this is revision five or six of this board as far as

708
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
 manufacturing goes.

709
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,960
 I do have prototypes with me if people want to go look at

710
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,840
 the actual PCB.

711
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,520
 You can find me in the NOC, which is over there near the

712
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
 fence to the camping area.

713
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
 It's a white tent.

714
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,120
 Please be polite/restrained when entering the tent.

715
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,800
 It's possible that people are working to debug the network.

716
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
 So if there is a rush of activity, then maybe come back

717
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,960
 a little bit later.

718
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,480
 I haven't actually pushed this out on GitHub yet.

719
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,280
 I plan to do that.

720
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,800
 You can find me on Mastodon Equinox at chaos.social.

721
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,520
 My GitHub is linked from Mastodon.

722
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,920
 And I think that's--

723
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,360
 cool.

724
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
 Thanks for attending.

725
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,040
 Big round of applause.

726
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,800
 [APPLAUSE]

727
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,760
