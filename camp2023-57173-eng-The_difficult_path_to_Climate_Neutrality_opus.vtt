00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.760
 Okay, let's start.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.440
 I'm sure all of us are aware of the ongoing climate crisis.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.760
 That's no surprise here.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.560
 And we as individuals can only do so much to counteract the problems,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.400
 as we all know, live with the big industries.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.280
 Hanno, here right beside me, climate scientist and a tea security researcher.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.200
 He will give us an overview of the challenges that those energy hungry

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 industries face and hopefully how they can be overcome.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.080
 Give it up for Hanno.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.080
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 >> Yeah, hello, just a correction.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm not a climate scientist, but I'm like an journalist and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.960
 write a lot about these topics, so yeah.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 Yeah, I want to talk about the climate crisis and what we can do about it.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.600
 And like as an intro, I want to show you this graph,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.880
 which is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.560
 And as you can see, it's going up.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.720
 And there's something important to understand here, and

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 that is it will keep going up as long as we add more CO2.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.400
 Even if we slow down in adding CO2, it will still go up, and it will go up slower.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.760
 So, and the conclusion from that is like reducing emissions is really not enough.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.880
 We need to essentially stop emissions, at least from CO2.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 For other greenhouse gases, it's a bit more complicated.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 But for CO2, it's really, if we keep adding CO2, then it's gonna get warmer, and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160
 we will have more problems.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.400
 Therefore, essentially, we have to eliminate CO2 emissions everywhere,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.160
 except maybe a few we might be able to compensate, but

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280
 that's like really difficult and expensive.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.440
 So essentially, we need to look everywhere where there are CO2 emissions, and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.400
 we need to get rid of them.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.560
 And when we talk about CO2 emissions, of course,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.160
 we often talk about things like this.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.720
 This is a coal power plant.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 This is very bad, and we should replace these with better types of energy,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.480
 like something like this.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 And of course, I know there are complications with that.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.960
 We need storage, intermittency, etc.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.400
 That's not my topic today.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 I'm aware of it.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.360
 But that's good to do that, but it's not enough.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 Because it's not just about electricity.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.160
 We have many other sources of emissions.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.040
 And for example, we have productions, things like steel production,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.720
 cement production, paper, plastics, aluminum, glass,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 aviation, shipping, agriculture, and a lot more.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.440
 And the interesting thing here, or this is for each of these pictures here,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 I could tell you a story why it's really difficult to get rid of these emissions,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.960
 why we will need new technologies to tackle these emissions.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.840
 Unfortunately, I don't have enough hours to talk about all of them.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.560
 So I will just talk about two.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 Yeah.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.320
 So the first thing I want to talk about is plastics.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.080
 I mean, we often talk about plastics when it's about waste handling or

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 microplastics, plastics pollution.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.240
 But the climate issues associated with plastics don't get talked about that much.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.720
 I think it's all because it's kind of a bit complicated, but

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.080
 that's what I want to explain to you and what we could do about it.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.120
 So we have, for example, things like this.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.600
 This is a steam cracker, which is one of the major facilities

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.640
 that produces chemicals that then are used to make plastics.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.640
 They have a lot of emissions themselves, but

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.720
 there are other issues associated with it.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.960
 So if you look at this in a bit more detail, so we have these steam crackers.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.280
 And they run, at least in Europe, I have to say.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.080
 It's different depending on where in the world you are.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.520
 They run on something called NAFTA, which is made from oil.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.000
 So you have oil drilling somewhere.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.800
 You get oil out of the ground.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.680
 It's a fossil fuel.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.320
 Then you have an oil refinery,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.800
 which kind of splits up this oil into different fractions.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.880
 And you get the usual stuff like gasoline for cars or kerosene for planes.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.880
 And one product these oil refineries also make is NAFTA,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.320
 which is what plastics are usually made of.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.600
 This NAFTA is fed into these steam crackers.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.120
 They need a lot of energy themselves because they need a lot of heat.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.280
 It's around 800 degrees Celsius.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.040
 That heat is also provided by fossil fuels.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.040
 That is usually fossil gas.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.560
 And that produces a lot of CO2 because when we burn gas, of course,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.280
 that makes CO2.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.000
 What comes out of these steam crackers are mainly the so-called olefins,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.240
 ethylene, and propylene.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.760
 If there are any chemistry teachers in here,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.440
 there are a lot of more things that come out of these steam crackers.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.960
 I try to simplify it as much as possible.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.440
 But these are the two most important chemicals that are used to make plastics.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.240
 And then there are further steps.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:56.200
 But these steam crackers are actually the ones where most of the energy is used.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.400
 But we also have to think about something else.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.680
 And that is what happens with the plastics after they have been used.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.960
 I mean, most plastics is things like packaging.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.720
 It gets used maybe for a few weeks.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.040
 And then it goes into the trash.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:19.800
 And if you look at this on a world scale, then most of the plastics

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 end up in landfills.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.520
 Around 20%, 19% is estimated to go into waste incinerators.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.760
 So it is burned to generate energy.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.280
 Then there's this category mismanaged, which essentially means either

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.120
 you throw plastics into nature or you burn it in your backyard.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.320
 That's not good, but that's what around 22% of plastics, what happens to it.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.160
 And then there's recycling, which is on a worldwide scale around 9%.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.440
 I should say here that this differs widely depending on where in the world

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.960
 you look.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.520
 For example, here in Germany, landfills are forbidden,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.480
 and most of the plastics is burned for energy.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.720
 Now, maybe we wait till the train is stopping here.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:18.200
 So no matter what, all of these cause emissions in some form.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.920
 So if it's mismanaged, so of course if you burn plastics in your backyard,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880
 you really shouldn't do that.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.760
 It's kind of illegal here.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.760
 It causes CO2, because if you burn something that is made from oil,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.200
 it causes CO2.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.160
 It also causes, of course, air pollution and other bad things.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.480
 But what you may not realize is if you throw plastics into the landscape,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.720
 it's not just a problem because it may harm nature or may cause microplastics,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.560
 but it can also cause emissions because these plastics can degrade,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.440
 particularly under sunlight, and they can form methane,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.400
 which is a highly active greenhouse gas, or ethylene,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.280
 which is, if you remember from earlier, one of the things that plastics is made of,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.080
 which is also a greenhouse gas.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:17.680
 Then landfills are also a source of methane emissions.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.960
 So one reason for that is that the same thing as if you throw it in nature,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.440
 if you have plastics and you have sunlight, then it may degrade.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.880
 But there's also an effect that in landfills,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.320
 usually they don't have just one type of waste,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.680
 but they have a mix of all kinds of things,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.320
 and the plastics can lead to the organic content of the landfill

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.120
 to degrade into methane as well.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.560
 So, yeah, there it gets a bit complicated,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.120
 but also there are greenhouse gas emissions from landfills.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.920
 Then waste incinerators, or I don't know, in Germany,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.640
 you call them Müllverbrennungsanlage.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.160
 Sometimes they are called waste to energy plants.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.240
 Essentially, you're burning waste for energy.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.520
 These have actually the highest CO2 emissions from all these things.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.640
 And I kind of only really realized this when I researched this,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.720
 that because in Germany, landfills are forbidden,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.560
 and we're basically burning most of the waste,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.800
 which is...

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.280
 And sometimes it's even...

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.960
 Waste incinerators are sometimes even considered as a type of green or clean energy.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.800
 But they are the highest...

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.160
 From the greenhouse gas emission perspective,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.400
 they are the highest emitting waste to treat waste plastics.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.640
 That's not to say we should go back to landfills.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.920
 Probably not, and probably we don't have the space anyway.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.840
 But it's an interesting thing to keep in mind.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.840
 Yeah, if you do recycling that has emissions from the energy,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.160
 this could be replaced by clean energy, and it's still kind of the best thing,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
 because you're not just doing something useful with the plastic,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.840
 then you're also replacing oil that is used for new plastics.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.560
 Instead, you're doing recycling.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.920
 So that's from all the not ideal options, it's the best.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.160
 But how should we think of these plastic end-of-life emissions?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.840
 And I really think the way we should think about this is that plastics are fossil fuels.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.480
 Like, they're made from oil, they contain carbon.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.920
 If you make new plastics, you add new carbon to the system,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.600
 and that will eventually be turned into some form of carbon emissions.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.960
 So really what we have to think about when we want to make plastics without carbon emissions,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.480
 we need to tackle two things.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.840
 We need to tackle the energy used to make plastics,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.520
 and we need to tackle the feedstock, like what these plastics are made of,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.560
 which is today usually oil or gas.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:08.120
 And for the energy, we could think about doing electrification.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.200
 Like, most of the energy needed is for heat,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.800
 and heat can be generated with electricity,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.680
 and then of course we have to worry about having enough clean electricity

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.640
 and having that reliably and in enough quantities.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.920
 But it's a pathway one could go.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:36.480
 So BASF is currently building the world's first electric steam tracker furnace in Ludwigshafen.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.280
 They have announced last year that they started construction.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.320
 I expect that they will soon announce probably that they have finished it and will start it.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.440
 But that's currently the only one worldwide.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.600
 And if you look at the numbers, don't consider these as super exact,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.640
 because what they publish is...

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:07.040
 I had to compare yearly capacities with hourly, but it's roughly around 1.8%.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.800
 So this is...

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.920
 Yeah, it's a start, but it's still a long way to go.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:24.240
 This electric furnace needs around 6 megawatts of electricity.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.080
 And if you calculate that, how much capacity they have there,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.400
 and if you scale that up, that would be 350 megawatts,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.880
 which is... I mean, that's a lot of electricity, but it's not inconceivable.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.280
 Like, that's something you could imagine happening.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:45.440
 So yeah, electric steam cracking, it's in early stages,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.840
 but it appears that this is something that is kind of doable.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:57.400
 The real challenge is replacing these fossil fuel feedstocks, like what is in the plastics itself.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.160
 And then one option to do this is there are a range of technologies

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.520
 that are sometimes called power-to-X or carbon capture and utilization.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.560
 What this means is that you're taking hydrogen, which you can make in a green way.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.240
 Today that's usually not happening, because today usually hydrogen is made from fossil gas,

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.440
 and that wouldn't make sense.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.120
 But if we had green hydrogen in large quantities, and then we can take CO2,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.360
 and out of these two gases, we can make all kinds of hydrocarbons.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.680
 So that is what's usually called either power-to-X or carbon capture and utilization, or CCU.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:46.760
 One issue there is, okay, then we need CO2, and where does this come from?

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.080
 You may say, yeah, that's easy, we take it from the next coal power plant.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.640
 But I mean, we want to get rid of these coal power plants,

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.760
 and if we add the CO2 from the coal power plants in our plastics and then burn them later,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.440
 then we'll have the CO2 from the coal later, so that doesn't really make sense.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.520
 So in the medium term, you might use industrial sources that cannot be avoided yet,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.000
 but in the long run, you basically only have the option to either use biomass,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.720
 or you use the CO2 from waste, which I'll get to later, or you take it from the air.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.320
 Taking it from the air is really expensive and requires really a lot of energy.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:36.160
 Yeah, but these technologies in general require a lot of energy.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.200
 Just making all this hydrogen is a very energy-intensive process.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.920
 There has been a study a couple of years ago, which I'm citing here,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:52.040
 that had estimated if you convert the whole chemical industry to such processes

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:59.400
 that take CO2 and hydrogen, then you would end up with something between 18 and 32 petawatt hours.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:05.520
 The wide range is depending on how optimistic you are about new technologies becoming available.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.040
 But just to compare that, the world electricity consumption today in total is 22 petawatt hours.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.040
 So you would roughly double the electricity consumption of the world

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:22.280
 if you convert the chemical industry to these power-to-X or CCU processes.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.320
 And I also have some numbers for Germany here, like the German Chemical Industry Association.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.120
 They had a report a few years ago where they came to more than 600 terawatt hours

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.640
 compared to, like, all of Germany uses 500 terawatt hours of electricity.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.520
 They have a newer report where they have somewhat lower numbers.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.080
 The main reason for that is that it's not really new technology or anything,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.480
 but it is that they have lower expectations for the growth of the German chemical industry.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.400
 And they looked at a few different technologies in that newer one,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.520
 and the low number, like the around 300, that would only be if you have very high amounts of recycling

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.040
 and very high amounts of biomass on top.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.920
 So if you're mostly setting on these CCU power-to-X technologies,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.000
 then you end up with something like we would have to double the electricity production

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 and get the electricity production clean in the first place,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.240
 and of course that new electricity should also be clean.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.120
 So, yeah, then you may wonder, okay, can we make this more efficient,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.200
 and are there alternatives to this?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.760
 And now there are different types of these power-to-X technologies,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.960
 and yeah, I'll go a bit into that in more detail.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.400
 So this is like a slight modification from the picture earlier,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.080
 where we have the steam cracker that gets NAFTA from an oil refinery,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.880
 and then there's the technology which is called a Fischer-Dropsch synthesis.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.280
 This has originally been developed to make oil out of coal,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:07.880
 but it can also be used to make something like raw oil from hydrogen and CO2.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.040
 So, and then we would basically just have this first step replaced,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.880
 and the rest could roughly stay the same.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.760
 I mean, we probably wouldn't want to make gasoline from that.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.200
 I know in Germany there's a debate whether you should do that.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.880
 It makes no sense, and it's only a debate in Germany.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.800
 But for things like chemicals and also for things like kerosene for airplanes,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.760
 which we should probably reduce, but we will have airplanes in the future probably,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760
 we might need to do this.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.400
 But there's another way to go about this,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.720
 and this is we'll have to look at China for this.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:56.800
 So in China, there's kind of a chemical industry that is based on coal.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.920
 Why? Because China does not have a lot of oil, and they have a lot of coal.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.960
 So there's a technology called coal gasification,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.920
 where you turn coal into something called syngas.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.920
 That is not clean at all. It causes a lot of emissions.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.560
 From there, you can go to methanol, which also causes a lot of emissions.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.440
 And then there's a technology called methanol to olefins,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.560
 which, as you might expect, turns methanol into olefins.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.960
 So these things where we make plastics from.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.000
 Now, you could imagine ignoring that thing on the left side

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.680
 and replacing it with something else.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.080
 Green methanol is a facility in Iceland.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.040
 It has been running since 2008.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.560
 It was like the first green methanol facility.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.120
 They are located close to a geothermal plant,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.440
 which gives them heat cheap from the geothermal plant.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.880
 It gives them CO2 from the geothermal plant, which is not widely known,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.640
 but geothermal plants also cause CO2 emissions.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.480
 And they have cheap electricity, with which they produce hydrogen.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.560
 And so from the hydrogen and the CO2 and with the heat, they produce methanol.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.360
 So this is technology that is in principle available.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.280
 Still requires a lot of electricity, but it's something that exists.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.760
 So, yeah, we could imagine having the picture before,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.520
 but replace the left part, like we have green hydrogen, we have CO2.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.640
 We make green methanol.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.160
 Then we have this methanol to olefins process,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.920
 which, of course, we also have to power by renewable energy.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.240
 But that's also mostly process heat, and that's doable.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:56.160
 And then we have these gases from which we can make plastics.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.600
 Now, you may say, OK, how far is this?

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.320
 And interesting enough, there's this company from Iceland

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.800
 that I just showed you that had built this first green methanol plant.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.920
 They have entered a collaboration with a Chinese company

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.680
 that is the biggest producer of these,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.680
 like the biggest operator of these methanol to olefin plants.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.800
 So this coal-based chemistry for plastics.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.040
 And they're starting to build a facility there

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.560
 where they use this green methanol technology

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.560
 to replace some of their methanol from coal.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.560
 Now, I should say there are a lot of caveats with this.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.120
 They are not using green hydrogen.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.240
 They are using hydrogen they get from other processes.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.480
 They are not using green electricity.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.040
 So it's not a full-scale chain of green production.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.920
 But still, this reduces emissions

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.040
 because these emissions from coal gasification are so high.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.120
 And it's kind of interesting that...

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.280
 I mean, if you would ask me what I think is the most interesting project

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.360
 in decarbonization of the chemical industry,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.040
 I would say it's kind of this.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.000
 Like, there's nothing in Europe anywhere that's at this scale

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.240
 and that combines these technologies

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.920
 that could lead to a chemical industry

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.120
 where we eventually may get along without fossil fuels.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.080
 So, yeah, we have two ways to go about this.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.840
 One would be we create NAFTA from this Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.840
 which we could call ENAFTA because we mostly use electricity.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.120
 And we have steam crackers, which we electrify.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.920
 Or we have green methanol,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.520
 and then we have this methanol to olefins process.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.880
 The methanol to olefins process is more efficient.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.640
 So that's the thing from China.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.400
 That's not me saying this,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.080
 but that is written in a document

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.200
 that the German Chemical Industry Association published.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.920
 And they kind of have an incentive to say it the other way

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.360
 because they have all these steam crackers.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.480
 So I kind of trust that that's accurate.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.080
 Yeah.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.680
 And, like, these steam crackers are amongst kind of the biggest

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.960
 and most expensive facilities the chemical industry has.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.480
 So this is something to think about.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.560
 Like, we have...

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.080
 It's probably not the technology to move forward with this.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.960
 Yeah.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.640
 What other options may there be?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.080
 So even if we have this more efficient process,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.160
 it still requires insane amounts of electricity

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.000
 that are probably not plausible to have.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.440
 Of course, and I really like to stress this

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.840
 every time I talk about whatever,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.120
 we could talk about using less plastics.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.680
 We should be aware of unintended consequences.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.400
 Like, for example, if we replace plastics with something

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.840
 that is even more damaging to the climate,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.840
 then that would not be a good idea.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.440
 Like, usually it's probably not a good idea, for example,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.720
 to use glass instead of plastics.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.520
 There are also issues that reducing plastic waste

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.680
 can harm, like, durability of food and things like that.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.400
 But in general, of course, if we can reduce plastics

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.240
 without negative consequences, that's a good thing.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.800
 Then we could use biomass.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800
 That's possible.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.480
 The problem with biomass is...

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.200
 I mean, the good thing about biomass and bioenergy

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.160
 is that we can basically replace all fossil fuels with biomass.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.800
 The problem is we don't have enough,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.720
 and if we start growing biomass for energy or other uses,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.640
 then that's usually not a good idea because then it needs land,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.120
 and that land would probably be better left to nature.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.040
 Some things like wetlands,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.200
 or, like, if we have leftover land to grow plants,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.160
 it's probably better to do renaturation or restoration of nature.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.480
 So we can use biomass, but we should consider biomass

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.920
 produced in a reasonable way is probably limited.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.440
 Then, of course, there's recycling as an option.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.360
 As I said earlier, recycling rate currently is around 9% worldwide,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.600
 but differs widely.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.120
 There are countries that go, like, up to 20%.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.000
 Sometimes you will hear much higher numbers.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.560
 They are usually kind of cheating with how they're calculating it.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.880
 But, like, if we would get, like, most of the countries

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.200
 to go to these upper levels of recycling,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.080
 that would already be a massive improvement.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.600
 The problem with recycling of plastics is that

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.680
 you need relatively pure inputs to do that

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.480
 because, like, you have different types of plastics,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.680
 and if you have a mixture of different plastics,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.480
 that cannot be recycled very well.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.600
 There's a set of technologies called chemical recycling,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.560
 sometimes also called advanced recycling,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.520
 which goes from the idea that instead of just melting plastics

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.160
 and making new things out of it,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.720
 you could break it down into more basic chemicals

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.080
 and then use these again to make new plastics.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.560
 There are two major technologies in that area.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.160
 One is called gasification, which is actually very similar

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.520
 to the coal gasification I was talking about earlier.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.160
 The other one is called pyrolysis, which...

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.480
 And an interesting aspect here is I also mentioned

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.280
 earlier these two options with either steam crackers

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.760
 or this methanol-based technology.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.760
 The gasification would be more compatible

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.760
 with this methanol-based process,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.560
 and the pyrolysis, you would kind of want to have a mix

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.960
 because you get something which is called pyrolysis oil,

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.680
 which you could feed into a steam cracker,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.160
 and you get syngas, which you could make methanol from.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.680
 So, depending on which road you choose on these

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.080
 power-to-x technologies, it may make sense to choose

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.760
 a certain route of these recycling technologies as well,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.000
 or you choose an intelligent mixture of both.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.880
 These chemical recycling technologies

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.280
 are also quite controversial,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.760
 and I think that's mainly because they have a bad history.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.280
 I don't know if anyone remembers Thermoselect?

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.280
 That was like gasification technology.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.240
 It was built in Karlsruhe and was a big failure.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.880
 And there have been a number of projects

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.560
 where these technologies have been tried,

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.720
 and it seems relatively difficult to get them to work.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.240
 Still, I think if this would provide a way

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.000
 to improve plastics recycling and recycle things

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.880
 that we cannot recycle now,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.960
 it would probably be a good thing,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.680
 and it should really be the goal from the waste

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 to use as much as possible from the carbon inside the waste

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.120
 to make new products.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.960
 But still, there will probably always be some waste

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.320
 that we cannot recycle.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.920
 So, we will probably still burn some waste.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.560
 But some things you could think about there is like,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.960
 okay, we could take the CO2 and just store it underground,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.000
 which is like carbon capture and storage technology,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.400
 which you've probably heard of.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.760
 I'm not gonna go into detail of that.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.960
 That's also very controversial,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960
 and there are a lot of things to say about it.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.120
 The other thing would be we could think about,

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.360
 okay, we burn the waste, then we have CO2,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.960
 and we could use that CO2 for these processes

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.280
 that we talked about earlier, where we need CO2

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.280
 to make new things like these Power2X or CCU processes.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.840
 All of that is not so easy because when you burn waste,

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.360
 you not just get CO2, you also get nitrogen,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.960
 and you get all kinds of other things

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.720
 because waste contains all kinds of things.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.560
 If you burn it, it produces all kinds of things.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.960
 So, you need to separate that,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.880
 and this hasn't been done before.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.760
 Like, there's currently no CCS or CCU facility

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.160
 on any waste incinerator anywhere.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.080
 There is one under construction in Oslo,

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.920
 but they just stopped construction

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.960
 because they ran out of money due to inflation

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.480
 and cost increases.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.080
 There is a project announced in Zellermeles

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.480
 where they want to use CO2 from a waste incinerator

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.480
 for methanol production, which sounds interesting.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.080
 I haven't found a lot of info about that project yet,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.080
 but, yeah, I'd be happy if that works.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.480
 Yeah, so to summarize this part,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.480
 yeah, we can make the chemicals we need for plastics

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.280
 from CO2 and hydrogen,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.280
 but that would require enormous amounts of clean energy.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.080
 This methanol to olefin technology,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.480
 which is today mostly used in China,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.680
 is probably more efficient than using the steam crackers

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.480
 that the chemical industry uses today.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.480
 And using less plastics, using biomass,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.480
 using more recycling, and maybe using new technology

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.480
 for recycling, all of that can help and can reduce

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.480
 the amount we will need with these crazy amounts of energy.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:28.480
 Yeah, the second example I want to talk about is glass.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.480
 Glass, of course, yeah, I mean, you know what glass is.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.480
 We make bottles out of it, we make windows out of it.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.480
 Glass is produced in furnaces at very high temperatures

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.480
 around 1,500 degrees.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.480
 It varies a bit depending on what type of glass,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.480
 but in that range,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.480
 and that is usually produced by fossil gas today.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.480
 Okay, so it's mainly heat.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.480
 Yeah, there are a few challenges with this.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.480
 One of it is these need to be interrupted,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.480
 operated without interruption.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.480
 So many of these glass companies were very concerned last year

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.480
 when there was talk about,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.480
 okay, maybe we will have gas shortages

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.480
 and some industries will be cut off gas.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.480
 That would basically mean you destroy a glass furnace

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.480
 if you stop running it.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.480
 Like if you cut them off their energy supply there, that's it.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.480
 Now you may wonder, okay, we mainly need heat.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.480
 Can we use electricity and, of course,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.480
 in the long run, green electricity to run that?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.480
 But that's difficult.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.480
 And it's actually not so difficult

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.480
 and it's actually not so hard to understand why.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.480
 So if you have a glass furnace, you have to imagine,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.480
 yeah, you're melting some stuff into glass at high temperatures

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.480
 and you're heating it from all sides.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.480
 And like replacing the heat from the side

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.480
 and from below with electric heaters,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.480
 that's kind of doable,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.480
 but then you also have a flame on top

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.480
 and that is you need to heat it from all sides

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.480
 so you get high quality glass and that it melts properly.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.480
 And from above, that is kind of where the challenge lies.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.480
 In 2008, a company in the US called Cameron Glass,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.480
 they said they can do this.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.480
 They can build a glass furnace purely electric.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.480
 They did it in an area where there was a lot of hydropower.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.480
 So this was kind of the first green glass production furnace.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.480
 I have to say, there are electric glass furnaces

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.480
 that are like for special types of glass,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.480
 but they are kind of small

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.480
 and they are not used for things like bottles or windows.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.480
 Like the big ones are a challenge.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.480
 So they tried this. It didn't work.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.480
 So the furnace was unable to heat the glass properly and evenly

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.480
 and there was a major accident.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.480
 The molten glass leaked out. Luckily, no one got hurt,

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.480
 but it was a multi-day incident where fire brigades had to come.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:19.480
 And this company filed for bankruptcy the year later.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.480
 And I had written an article about this,

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.480
 like the question of how to decarbonize glass last year,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.480
 and I talked to a few people from the industry

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.480
 and like everyone mentioned this thing.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480
 They tried this with electricity

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.480
 and that was kind of the incident for our industry

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.480
 where we got scared of this.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.480
 But then you can ask,

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.480
 "Okay, but can we maybe use mostly electricity and some gas?"

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.480
 And that is what the industry is currently trying.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.480
 So there are two projects for hybrid glass furnaces,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.480
 and I'm happy to say this here,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.480
 because when I wrote about it last year,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.480
 what I had to write was, yeah, there was a project,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.480
 but it was cancelled because they didn't get the funding.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.480
 Now they got the funding from somewhere else.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.480
 This is the first one here on the list.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.480
 These are our next-gen furnace.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.480
 It's a glass company in Germany that they want to build.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.480
 I think they want to go 80% electric and 20% gas.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.480
 There's another very similar project in Czechia,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.480
 and they just got funding from the EU Innovation Fund,

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.480
 which is a EU program for major decarbonization projects.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.480
 So these projects are on the way,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.480
 and they will hopefully be realized within the next couple of years.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.480
 Then, okay, we still have some gas left.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.480
 We could imagine, okay, maybe we can replace that leftover gas with green hydrogen.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.480
 That would be kind of the next step.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.480
 And if we have enough green hydrogen,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.480
 which by itself is a huge challenge,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.480
 then we could decarbonize the energy supply for glassmaking.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.480
 But there's still another problem, like even if we do that.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.480
 So what is glass actually made of?

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.480
 So standard glass contains three main ingredients.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.480
 One is so-called silica.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.480
 That is not a problem.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.480
 The other two are limestone, which is chemically calcium carbonate, or CaCO3.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:32.480
 And the other is so-called soda, which is sodium carbonate, Na2CO3.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.480
 Some chemical formulas. I hope nobody is scared of that.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.480
 And these are called carbonates, and they contain carbon.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.480
 So what happens in the glass furnace?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.480
 If you heat these things up, they turn into other minerals.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.480
 So this calcium carbonate turns into calcium oxide, and that produces CO2.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:01.480
 The sodium carbonate turns into sodium oxide, and that also produces CO2.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:08.480
 And yeah, so the mineral inputs that are used to make glass,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.480
 they contain carbon, and this causes emissions.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.480
 And there's really no good solution for this.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.480
 Like, okay, we can do recycling.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.480
 Like, if we recycle more glass, then we already have these transformed chemicals,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480
 and then we don't have these emissions.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.480
 But we will never have perfect recycling, so that can only go up to a certain point.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.480
 Yeah, also maybe carbon capture and storage.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.480
 I also asked the people from the glass industry.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.480
 They said they don't think that's really workable,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.480
 because if you wanted to carbon capture and storage,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.480
 you also need CO2 pipelines and things like that.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.480
 And these glass production facilities are relatively small,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.480
 and they're relatively distributed.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.480
 So that's kind of challenging if you want to get the CO2 and then store it somewhere.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:06.480
 Yeah, so to summarize the glass making, yeah,

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.480
 making a fully electric glass furnace, that's difficult.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.480
 We may be able to have mostly electric hybrid furnaces

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.480
 that run with green electricity and green hydrogen,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.480
 and that could decarbonize the energy supply.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:28.480
 But there's really no solution yet for these emissions from these minerals or carbonates.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.480
 Yeah.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.480
 More general conclusions from my talk.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.480
 And this is really the message I want to get across.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:45.480
 Like, if we want to fix climate change, or whatever you want to call it,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.480
 basically almost every industry needs to change.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.480
 They need to change their processes in major ways to avoid emissions.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.480
 And many of these are really in early stages.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.480
 Like, we have ideas how to do this.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.480
 Maybe we have pilots.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.480
 Maybe we have early stage developments.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.480
 But a lot of that has really not been tried in larger scales.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.480
 Yeah, that's what I just said.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.480
 Yeah, and that's also like a big message.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.480
 We will need a lot of green electricity to make that happen.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.480
 I mean, looking at it from a place like Germany,

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.480
 we probably won't have all that green electricity.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.480
 We will also have to think about what can we import.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480
 Like, if you think about these chemical productions,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.480
 maybe we can import green methanol and then...

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.480
 Yeah, but that's really like...

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.480
 We need enormous amounts of clean electricity,

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.480
 and I think that's not really realized at the scale that it will be necessary.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.480
 I also have a small advertisement blog,

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.480
 because earlier I said there are all these other things I could also talk about.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.480
 And of course you probably want me to talk about that.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.480
 I want to try doing talks like this, but for the internet on YouTube.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.480
 You can subscribe there.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.480
 And I also write a newsletter where I write about these things.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.480
 I've written, for example, about some steel decarbonization and cement and things like that.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.480
 Yeah, if you want to subscribe there, I also have flyers with the URLs,

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.480
 so yeah, take that if you're interested.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.480
 And yeah, I think we have some time for questions.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:39.480
 Yes, thank you very much, Hannu, for that very insightful talk.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.480
 [Applause]

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.480
 So yes, we have about six minutes for Q&A.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.480
 Do you have any questions? And please raise your arm.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.480
 We have a very friendly and highly visible angel who will bring a microphone.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.480
 Yes, please.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.480
 Hey, at the beginning you had the slide with many, many, many processes.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.480
 Yeah.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.480
 And you took two now out of them.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.480
 Which of them is the biggest one?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.480
 How is the percentage of the energy consumption?

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.480
 Steel is the biggest from the amount of emissions.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.480
 Steel is like 12% if you add the electricity that you need for the steel,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.480
 and 7% if you only look at the steel plant itself.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.480
 Next question, please. Yes.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:33.480
 Yes, you said that a lot of clean energy is needed to do this decarbonization of the industry.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:41.480
 But what about mining? What about all the stuff we need to build all this clean energy?

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.480
 Is that even possible?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:50.480
 The mining is not as much of a problem as people tend to think.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.480
 So what you need to realize is that if you look at mining today,

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.480
 what we're mining is mostly coal and oil and gas.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.480
 So if we go to clean energy, we will mine a lot less.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.480
 We will mine different things.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.480
 We will need new mines in new locations.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.480
 All of that has challenges.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.480
 But there have been a few studies.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.480
 There isn't really any mineral or material where there's a major shortage

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.480
 or where you couldn't imagine doing that mining.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 And really I think this is an important message.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.480
 The amount of mining will be reduced if you go to clean energy.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.480
 Okay, back there, please.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.480
 Thanks for your talk. Thanks for your explanation.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480
 My question is what about degrowth?

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.480
 So is it really realistic to think that we can keep all the industry that we have

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.480
 and we can just keep producing if we solve the problem of carbon emissions?

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.480
 Yeah, thanks for the question.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.480
 I mean, you noticed that at some point I mentioned using less.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.480
 What about this degrowth question?

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:05.480
 The way I think about it, so my problem is that often it seems these debates are

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.480
 either you want degrowth or you want technology.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.480
 I think we should use all the technologies that make sense.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.480
 And then we should look at them and look at the things that are really difficult

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.480
 and probably reduce those.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:29.480
 And to say it, I think the most difficult things are chemicals like plastics and aviation.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:36.480
 Like these are where you come to these really enormous amounts of energy needed.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.480
 And I think for aviation that's the most controversial one probably.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.480
 Are there any more questions?

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.480
 Oh, yes, right in front here.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.480
 The microphone is running.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.480
 Yes, please.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.480
 If I've seen it right, you have green hydrogen in all of these processes, right?

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.480
 In the ones I talked about, yeah.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.480
 So CO2 neutrality won't be happening without green hydrogen.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.480
 Where will this green hydrogen come from?

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.480
 I mean, you mentioned that because we are in Germany.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.480
 In Germany we have a very specific party and they are talking about green hydrogen for cars.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.480
 Ignore that one for a second.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.480
 Yeah, it's a challenge.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.480
 I could give another talk on that.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.480
 So the issue with green hydrogen, I mean, first of all it requires a lot of energy.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.480
 So we could think about doing that somewhere where we have a lot of sun,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.480
 like in Australia or somewhere in Africa.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.480
 The other problem is transporting hydrogen is really difficult.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.480
 For example, I don't see shipping of hydrogen happen.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:53.480
 That just doesn't make sense from the amount of energy you lose with that.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:43:01.480
 And then you could come to this idea that maybe we should talk about where to produce what

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:08.480
 and think about maybe we should make steel in Australia or in Africa.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:15.480
 But if you say that in Germany then someone shouts deindustrialisierung and then the debate gets difficult.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.480
 But I think we need to talk about this.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.480
 All right, there's another question right here in front.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.480
 Yeah, one very practical thing.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:29.480
 You said in a side note that it's probably better to use plastic bottles instead of glass bottles.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.480
 Could you elaborate a little bit on that?

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.480
 I mean, we like ditch plastic bottles so we do glass bottles.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:40.480
 But what's it with when we have plastic bottles we reuse?

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.480
 Yeah, I mean, reusing a bottle is always better, right?

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.480
 It doesn't matter what it's made of.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.480
 I mean, producing glass requires more energy.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:01.480
 And then there's also like if you transport glass, it's heavier and then it also requires more energy.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:09.480
 And like both are difficult to decarbonize.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.480
 All right, if there are any more questions later, I'm sure you can find Hanu on the camp.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:20.480
 Let's give it up for him again, please. Thank you very much.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.480
