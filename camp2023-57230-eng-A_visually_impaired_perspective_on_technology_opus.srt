00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:36,240
 Welcome everybody. Life in Toxic Bits of Boimer. We're starting with AJ Hamilton, who is presenting

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:53,520
 a visually impaired perspective on technology. Welcome AJ Hamilton.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,600
 Hi, really excited to be here. First lightning talk of CCC. My name is AJ, my pronouns are

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,320
 they them. My email is on the screen, aj@martinh.net. Here's my talk, a visually impaired perspective

6
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,040
 on technology. I would like to start by saying I cannot answer any questions about things

7
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,480
 like CSS or HTML because I do not have any design experience making accessibility features.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,700
 Apologies. But it's the truth. Okay. So, yes, I'm a visually impaired person. My condition

9
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,840
 is a rare genetic one that causes my sight to sort of slowly get blurrier throughout

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,040
 my life. And currently it's at a level where I basically use like zooming and stuff like

11
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,080
 that just to do anything with technology. And I don't use screen readers. So you may

12
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,400
 be familiar with screen readers. May not be. But basically they read out the screen for

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,960
 visually impaired people. So here I've got what my vision looks like. This is through

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,640
 a handy app which I can explain if anyone wants me to. It's got a bit of a complicated

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,560
 set up but it can simulate different vision levels for a few conditions. So we've got

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,200
 this here. This is me making this PowerPoint. I don't think you can see that well anyway.

17
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:21,000
 But basically it's not very good. Then you've got here a bit of Terraria. And you can't

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 really tell what is going on on the screen. You can't see where the inventory is, what's

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,520
 selected, anything like that. So some specific problems that I've highlighted as sort of

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,560
 day to day problems that visually impaired technology users have. First one. I meant

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,880
 to hide that slide. Fixed font sizes. So a lot of apps and some websites but it is mostly

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,280
 apps for this problem do not have adjustable font sizes. And especially some of them don't

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,240
 adjust to your system preferences which is quite annoying because, you know, you do all

24
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,520
 this work to set up your preferences and then it's just ignored. And even the Apple notes

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,760
 app which Apple is normally very good but the notes app has no way of changing the font

26
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,960
 size. And then even when you do have adjustable font sizes, you can often get it to break

27
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,480
 like this. So we have here we have three screen shots, one of Spotify where you've got some

28
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
 menu items clipping into each other. Song names not being fully shown. You've got a

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,520
 laundry app in the middle which is almost completely unreadable. And then you've got

30
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,320
 a Sane 3's email there on the end which has text just completely squashed into each other.

31
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:51,760
 It is really not very good. Old text. That has come out interestingly. Yeah, so old text,

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,400
 if there's anyone who doesn't know what old text is, it is an alternative description

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:04,280
 of an image for blind visually impaired people. So this was a tweet by Spencer Kelly, a tech

34
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,360
 journalist with the BBC. Now the tweet says my dear friends came to visit today and they're

35
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,720
 extremely gifted son provided this service free of charge. And it took him less than

36
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,320
 a minute. Now this image did not come there was an image that came with this and it did

37
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,680
 not come with any old text. So my granddad who sent this to me, he really he did not

38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,840
 know what was going on. Now eventually he managed to figure it out. It was this. A Rubik's

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,120
 Cube. Now, yes, it is very important to have old text and especially old text generated

40
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,480
 by humans because when an AI was used to attempt to generate old text for this image, it generated

41
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,780
 a person wearing a red shirt and standing in front of a blue background. AI is not good

42
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:03,240
 enough for this. You need humans. And okay, as a summary, I've put together four points

43
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,200
 of general really basic things that can just make our lives a lot easier as visually impaired

44
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,320
 technology users. We've got number one, make your font sizes adjustable and test them to

45
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,440
 make sure that they work at all levels. Number two, always add old text, please, please, please.

46
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,520
 It helps so many people and it saves a lot of time. Number three, test all of your accessibility

47
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
 features and combine them. So for example, if you've got a colorblind mode and a dark

48
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,920
 mode, put them together and see if you get a disco. And final one, number four, keep

49
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,480
 your design simple and consistent. A simple design can be amazing because you don't have

50
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,140
 to go around looking at 20 different buttons, trying to figure out what all of them do.

51
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,320
 And consistency means that we can actually work by memorizing what the buttons do because

52
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,000
 a lot of the time we can't actually see what we're clicking on. We're just memorizing positions.

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,440
 So when your UI changes, it is a massive problem. Yeah. So try and keep UI changes to a minimal

54
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,240
 or just better make it accessible in the first place. All right. And thank you for coming.

55
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,040
 Yeah. My name is AJ, pronounce they/them, email on the board, and I will be around to answer

56
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,240
 any questions, talk about accessibility, if you have any software you want me to look

57
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,920
 at, anything like that. Thank you for listening.

58
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,160
