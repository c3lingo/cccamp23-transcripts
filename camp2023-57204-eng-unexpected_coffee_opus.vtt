 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:38.880
 Okay, I think we are ready and on our way to dive into the very exciting world of

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.360
 industrial coffee makers and without further ado I give the stage to you guys.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.280
 Well then, welcome to our talk "Unexpected Coffee,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.000
 Adivin to Industrial Coffee Machines". I'm Hethi, I'm doing offensive security at daytime

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 and at night time I'm doing industrial coffee machine hacking and other fun projects.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.960
 And that's Datacop. Hi, I'm Clemens or Datacop or Data for short.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.000
 And I'm mainly, I'm an electrical engineer but mainly doing networks and embedded Linux systems and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 yeah. And that's the car. But if that's fine with you, we will just go on. So first things first,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.600
 what's a coffee machine or what's an espresso machine? We have coffee beans, we ground the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.440
 beans and then we add basically just hot water under pressure and then we have good coffee if

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:13.280
 we did it right. And then what's a vending machine? And there are different types of vending machines.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.840
 There are basically two base types and one is there are those instant beverage machines

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.080
 where you just get a cup and you press a button and you get something that was

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.800
 made from water more or less. But typically it's just powder. And there are the other vending

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:47.680
 machines like stuff in boxes or vending machines for bottles and so on. We won't go into this detail

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:58.640
 but that's for the first part and what we actually have here. And then what's an espresso vending

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.200
 machine? And that's more or less a hybrid of an espresso machine and a typical powder-based

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.200
 vending machine. And that means we have the best and the worst of both worlds actually.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:28.240
 We have not really a perfect coffee brewery and then we also have those powder things and not

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:38.000
 really milk or anything. But they exist and they're quite huge usually and they allow special

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.320
 combinations like latte macchiato which I will go in a bit in a detail on how this is made actually

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:58.160
 here in a few slides. And then basic stuff in this machine we have coffee and we have toppings.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.680
 For the coffee we have a brewer that will be on the next slide also and we will open the machine

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.840
 later too. And that one is designed for more or less a specific high throughput especially for office

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:24.080
 like 300 coffees per day. And also for low maintenance. So these machines typically

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.720
 don't need daily maintenance like big espresso machines but those are more or less I think you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.560
 should clean them once a week but that's just a quick cleaning cycle and then the large cleaning

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.040
 cycle if I can remember it correctly it's done more or less once per month and typically not

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.560
 by the company where this machine is standing but by a separate company that's also supplying

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.520
 the coffee and all the ingredients. Those machines typically have fixed water installations that's

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:08.240
 why we have a pump here and an external water tank and luckily this machine in the manual has

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.800
 a note that says if you don't have fixed water by the way the water input valve has a rating so you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:26.000
 can hook up a pump there with 24 volts and 1.5 amps max which was quite nice for the camp. Or you can

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.560
 also buy an add-on for it there is also add-on with a big tank and you can buy it from the vendor too.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.840
 There are also different add-ons you can like put on the side and so on so it's like buying a car

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.840
 more or less you can have all kinds of customizations and then yeah we have fixed water,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:54.160
 we have coffee beans and milk. It's usually just supplied as milk powder and those are toppings.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.880
 So there are different types there are also vegan types and we this machine currently is

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.040
 filled completely with vegan toppings and to actually mix the powder with the hot water

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:19.920
 we have or inside there are some mixer wheels more or less so you can see here on the left

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.600
 or not really well but we will see later in the machine on the left there is the coffee brewer

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:39.920
 more or less. Please don't break any stuff. In the middle we have more or less the closed mixer so

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.520
 from the top the toppings will drop in and will be mixed inside of this bowl with water and on

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.320
 the right there is basically a second one but that's just a mixer wheel so that's the opened mixer

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.560
 and that mixer makes the mixture creamy and mixes the water with the topping so you don't have

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:10.480
 crumbs in it and you can also run the motor at different speeds for example for the latte macchiato

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:20.720
 I mentioned earlier latte macchiato typically is or for these machines is milk in the middle it's

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.120
 coffee and then it's milk again and the machine actually makes this differently it does two

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.640
 pieces of milk and then the coffee on top and this works because the milk is mixed at different

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:44.400
 speeds of the mixer so they have different physical properties so that the coffee will actually

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.240
 be in a layer between the two milk layers although the milk powder is exactly the same.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:08:00.080
 So that's quite interesting it's how those vendors come up with quite a few hacks on how to do

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.120
 premium coffee things and so on.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:12.320
 And this is the whole machine how it was also set up at Lavendville inside of the camp area

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.560
 in the MetaLab dome and it will be later set up again there so if you want a coffee or

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.400
 some cocoa feel free to go there and use the machine and but you can see here you

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:33.680
 or we have three of those white containers where the powder toppings are inside there and those

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.560
 have a motor that will basically put in the powder into the mixer bowls.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:55.760
 And about this machine this is the company is called Rea Vendors it's a quite large company

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:04.400
 and it seems to be initially located in Italy and the machine itself is called La Rea Grande Ti

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:14.960
 and then some we don't know what they what the rest actually means but

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:24.560
 there are different types of this machine. Last year at MetaLab we got a mail from somebody who

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.760
 said that they have at their office this machine and it's broken since a year and they want to get

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:40.400
 rid of it and if we would be interested in repairing it or doing some other stuff with it

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:49.680
 they didn't want to just throw it away but to maybe give it to people who repurpose it or repair it.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:59.920
 And we both saw the mail and wrote to each other like a coffee machine and in the worst case we

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.680
 can always build a coffee pot out of it a cocktail pot yeah for the Robo Exotica

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:15.440
 and the initial error was that the brewer motor failed initializing and for the brewer motor is

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.920
 if we go to back to the picture if you have the brewer on the left you see that there is a piston

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:29.120
 inside and this piston is moved or the whole brewing chamber is moved for like 15 to 20 centimeters

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.680
 for the whole mechanism to work.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:42.640
 So just before repairing it it was standing around the MetaLab or hex space for like three

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.640
 or four months and it annoyed quite some members because we don't have so much space

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.840
 but in the end we were motivated to take our time and repair it and so we're going to show

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.520
 you now the repair process how we debugged it and how we managed to repair it.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:06.960
 Okay so the company or the people we got it from already said that they think it is probably a

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:15.520
 MOSFET power driver problem for the motor and so we were debugging a bit of the electronics and

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:24.720
 that's the board on the back of the machine so there are several boards we will go into the

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.360
 different boards in the slides too in a bit but there is one main board and that's in the back

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.480
 and there is all the power electronics there and all the motors are connected to this and there

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:48.560
 were two or the first you on the right the bigger MOSFETs we suspected at first so

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.080
 that was all the information we got from the people that they assumed that they are broken

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.520
 yeah but they they tried to order them the electronics and it's actually this data sheet

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:09.280
 there are some automotive MOSFETs and that's a bit interesting most of the electronics is actually

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:20.720
 automotive grade we don't know why but well endurance and yeah coffee coffee is critical

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:29.680
 infrastructure so that was our first try and they tried to order them but they are not complying

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:38.160
 with the arrow hs directive of the eu so they are not lead free so you can't get them at mauser or

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:46.720
 any other electronics company anymore but aliexpress for the win yeah that was really like

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:57.920
 five seconds of search and we found a bunch of them it turned out those MOSFETs weren't the

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.480
 problem so we swapped them they're actually new inside there now but those were not the actual

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:12.400
 problem so we further debugged the motor itself there is a pcb on side of on top of the motor

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:21.200
 and a magnetic wheel so when the motor turns there is a turn signal or there is a tachometer signal

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.280
 back to the main pcb that tells the

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:35.040
 microcontroller how far it has moved and also with current sensing basically the microcontroller

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:43.040
 can sense how much pressure the motor is currently applying to the whole brewing unit and we thought

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:52.240
 maybe this these sensors are actually at fault so we took a large oscilloscope for no reason and

00:13:52.240 --> 00:14:02.160
 a power supply but those were actually working quite nice and then since the machine needs water

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.960
 we need to go to the kitchen we had to set up the whole thing in the in the kitchen yes

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 including the oscilloscope and annoyed more people

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:21.920
 um so what we actually did there is we did a bit of tracing of on the pcb

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:29.920
 where the motor lines are actually or the motor connections are actually going to and it turned

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:39.840
 out they are they are split from for high and low sides into two chips and one of those chips

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:52.560
 yeah so on the left you can see there is this larger chip right next to the blue capacitor

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.840
 and there are two chips right below it and it's quite interesting those are for completely

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:06.480
 different motors and i or we think they did it this way because the upper chip does very well

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:17.680
 power sensing so you can get an analog value out of the chip for each output how much

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:24.480
 what's basically are going out to the motor and the lower chips are the lower side of the

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.280
 of the motor controller that basically just

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:38.720
 yeah control the negative side of the depending on how you turn the motor and those are can

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.320
 actually also do current sensing and they're not just standard mosfets they have some kind

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:52.800
 of electronics inside of there so you can you can break them a bit more difficult and also on the

00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:02.640
 input pin you can actually do power sensing so if you supply a logic value to the input pin to actually

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:11.760
 to switch through the mosfet or to switch the mosfet and it's and the mosfet goes into power

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:19.200
 limiting it will try to lower the voltage on its input pin depending on how much overcurrent it

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:28.160
 is currently having so this was not implemented on the board but those are quite interested

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:37.840
 quite interesting features of those mosfets so and also again aliexpress and then after after

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:45.280
 clements clements did the soldering we started to pray for the first boot again and yeah we had our

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.920
 first success we had got the first coffee out of the machine but um

00:16:49.920 --> 00:17:01.360
 it was cafe schwarz and it was really black and we didn't want to risk a subscription for the toilet

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.880
 because the machine wasn't clean for like one or two years so we started the cleaning process

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.160
 so we cleaned the whole machine and we brought you some pictures of the cleaning process

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:24.240
 and it was quite dirty and after that the machine was like like new and the good thing is the

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.400
 the company that produced the machines offers

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.800
 the machine that produced the machine offers a really good manual how to disassemble the parts

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.240
 and everything so it was quite easy to disassemble it and assemble it again and yes we had a clean

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.160
 machine and as next we're going to show you some more parts of the electronics

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.240
 okay um

00:17:50.240 --> 00:18:04.240
 thanks okay so um there are actually three bigger pcbs inside one is the one we showed before that's

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:11.200
 the main pcb in the back that basically has most of the power stuff and then in the front we have

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.280
 a touch display and that one was really interesting when we opened the machine the first time because

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:26.720
 we saw that that's an arm imx6 processor so it's running pretty we were pretty sure it's running

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:34.560
 linux and also there is an sd card inside and it has some usb and a gigabit ethernet port that's

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:42.240
 everything of this is not used so you can use the usb port to program the machine

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:55.120
 but this also seems to be added later or it was added later and the second or the third pcb is

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.480
 a real power pcb because there is no no typical boiler inside of this machine

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.280
 it has an induction boiler so it can basically vary

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:15.840
 it can basically change the temperature of the water on the fly so if when it's currently running

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:23.280
 it's not heating the water if you press a button on or if you want a beverage it's basically

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:31.360
 heating the water on the fly and not taking too much energy and also it's quite interesting

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:39.680
 you can program different water temperatures for the different outlets and depending when they are

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:47.600
 switched over the valves you can get a mixture of different water temperatures which is i think

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:55.680
 quite unique for this machine and also for repairing or for for taking it apart those machines are

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:04.000
 typically really big so there is a lot of space inside you can more or less take the whole machine

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.360
 apart you can replace everything you can you can really maintain the machine quite well so

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:22.160
 compared to those cheap plastic machines also that are sometimes on on smaller offices

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:30.960
 these machines can basically live forever if you have enough supply of a few things that might

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.920
 break like the valves or so on but they're all standard valves well then let's check out the

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.480
 software hardware setup so as said glans already said we have two components there there is like

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.480
 this there is a cpu inside it's like a mic controller 16-bit industrial or coffee processing unit

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:58.080
 and there is a gpu it's a imx6 arm linux board and on this linux system there is a qt binary running

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:06.720
 with displaying the rear gui on the display the rear gui is a html javascript based web application

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.320
 and you can run it in your browser actually it doesn't make coffee but it says it does and there

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:24.800
 is a rear boot exe file so you have an exe file you have an arm cpu and if linux running what

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:35.120
 um let's solve the mystery it's a dot net binary for flashing configuration files and extracting

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:45.120
 configurations and it's run with mono on the linux arm processor well it works it it works

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:54.240
 and uh when you and you put in a flash drive with a specific folder structure it boots this

00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:01.440
 this uh this tool to to to put the config on it or to get the config and i must say i still

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.600
 understand how the boot procedure still works because you have the qt binary and the and the

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:11.120
 config binary and i'm still not sure how they know when to start what i tried to find it didn't

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:18.960
 manage to find it in the system so um you have also a windows tool to program it it it looks like

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:30.240
 this it's uh let's say last century more or less the the red picture down there is also animated

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:39.280
 also quite nice i'm sure that was a feature request and but i must say even though the ux is quite

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:46.720
 questionable it is super powerful comfortable configuration like this you can really make a

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.000
 power saving menus you can make happy hours you have a really a lot of configuration options for

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.360
 the machine it's super nice but the interface is quite interesting let's say like that but let's

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:06.000
 get on the program on the machine part so there is a programming menu in the machine itself a touch

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:17.760
 screen it looks like this you see different buttons uh it doesn't look very um comfortable

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:24.960
 to use and i will come back later to to this part why and what uh let's first also check out the web

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:32.800
 app um if you press the manual online button it will actually display the pdf of the manual of

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.800
 the machine from dsd card on the tft display and you can scroll through it it's quite nice but it's

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 also a bit annoying to scroll i think there are a few hundred pages um so there is this web app it's

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.920
 html page and uh when you're on the menu you can choose the beverage in the end and there is like

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:02.720
 a page menu html where the beverage is shown and if you choose a beverage you come to a page confirm

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.840
 page and uh they have like the selector is still like the parameter what what coffee or cacao you

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:20.240
 want and if you press the confirmation one it goes to another html page and uh when you confirm it

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.760
 there is this qt binary as far as i understand understand the process it will check the url with

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.840
 the parameter and will know what coffee or beverage it will make and when it's done it will change the

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:41.920
 url again in the binary that you come to the done page and will switch back to the menu so so the

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:50.640
 api between the web page and the uh the qt binary is actually the url parameters so the the qt

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.920
 binary manage the whole whole html in the back in the end and uh shows it there let's show you some

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:05.440
 excerpt from the javascript files that found so that's how you how you how it's implemented on

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:15.040
 the javascript the whole thing are like arrays in javascript and they have a name and a picture path

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:23.600
 and you can change the names you can change the pictures and it's also quite interesting one

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.280
 even more interesting is the the javascript for the prices

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:36.640
 like every array part is one of the beverage with the price in cents

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.320
 but i'm not even sure if the machine knows what currency it's running on so seems so that there

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:52.480
 is no currency logic behind it but i was digging in the binary the really interesting thing is when

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.760
 starting it up it's actually uh it updates those files the binary updates those files but i will

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.800
 show you know what so i was digging at qt binary with githra and i found this function in there

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:14.080
 it's called generate javascript price and availability and uh let's see what this means

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:23.520
 so there is code that generates the javascript down there from the binary from from text more

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.120
 or less yeah from sex so the binary generates the javascript file in the end because the config is

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:38.720
 on the machine and not on the html files and javascript files um so next uh we also check

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.680
 the communication between the machine and the front and more or less yeah so between the linux

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 system in the front and the the 16 bit uh processor in the back uh there is a serial port and uh

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:05.600
 we already saw in the linux system that it's opening the tty on the imx um board more or less

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:14.240
 and then just found s trace in the system and we're like okay easy task let's try this out

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:24.560
 and found that um so you can see uh dark red and uh dark green lines here and one line per or they

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:32.160
 um they just uh one is sent uh to the machine or to the controller one comes from the machine the

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.560
 red line comes from the controller in the back in the back and the green line is sent to the

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:45.760
 controller from the front linux system and it's roughly every second and if you don't do anything

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.600
 here um more or less the binary command that's or the binary message that's sent from the linux

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:59.520
 system is more or less always the same um the the red messages are interesting because uh in the

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:06.800
 middle um there is this text that the machine displays in the lower half of the machines

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:16.240
 or the display displays in the lower half of the machine um so um and it has a quite weird encoding

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:25.680
 because uh if you see on the in the top here um there is uh in german for the uh for this trace

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:32.960
 uh filled wasa off bitter vaten and between off between the two words off and bitter there is no

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:41.200
 space there is no character no anything between there and that was quite weird for us um and also

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.400
 um there was a weird break on the display too so there there was like a space between the two

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:53.760
 words but it was not just a regular white space so more information about it it's a binary protocol

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:01.840
 so the first part is always binary and the last part is always a binary code and also the commands

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:15.280
 that are sent from the touch display to the back are some binary messages and those texts with a

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:24.320
 missing space in the middle when debugging this or let's see uh let's look at it here um when

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:33.920
 counting the characters uh we always found that the whole text is 32 characters long and the middle

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:45.920
 part where there is no space is always 16 characters or add 16 characters and who did a bit more of

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:55.200
 electronics probably already knows where the software comes from we like okay hmm and then

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.400
 we realized in the end there is this corrector display shout out 20 for the photo box in the

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:09.440
 binary kitchen tent and in the end the text is usually shown on such a corrector display

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:16.000
 and they in the end only use this display to show the characters instead to implement a proper

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.080
 software for it because the older machines only have these buttons and a corrector display in the

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:29.360
 end so the buttons you saw on that on the touch display for the programming menu probably on a

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:36.640
 previous version of this machine um the those were actually real buttons and the texts are sent for

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:44.400
 those 16 uh characters uh by two lines so 32 characters displays you have in this in this

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:51.520
 really old vending machines and um probably uh the whole back of the machine so thinks that it's some

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:59.280
 kind of machine that has physical buttons and no touch display and for a block diagram so those

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:07.440
 are the three um pcbs we have the the heater board we have the cpu and power board and the linux board

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:16.000
 that's connected over serial and everything that is part of the machine even payment and some and

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.520
 some kind of modem you can plug in is connected to the 16-bit controller so what is a bit frustrating

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:31.200
 because we are hoping to do more hacking from the linux system but we have to deal with the 16 16

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:39.040
 bit controller so it's super hard to you need to reverse engineer every option in the end to

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.920
 implement the same binary protocol to configure the whole machine and work with it it's quite

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:54.640
 tedious task in the end and then let's get to our lessons learned um always verify claims if someone

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:02.720
 makes them because uh well sometimes they are not uh correct aliexpress sells you automotive ships

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.600
 that you don't get in europe or in austria especially the only problem in austria is we

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.800
 have real luck because in austria is a new law that you can't get easy stuff anymore because of

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.880
 some packaging directive and we are really lucky because it was from the first of january 2023

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.600
 in charge and we ordered it like in december and got it before that really lucky for us i think

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.240
 we actually got it in january or in january but still delivered but currently aliexpress doesn't

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:38.320
 deliver to austria or not a lot most of aliexpress sellers um as you see industrial equipment is state

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:45.040
 of the art legacy it's it's really it was a little bit heartbreaking for us to see the reality that

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:52.800
 we deal with and one interesting thing is also the windows configuration software is not publicly

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.960
 available and we currently doesn't have the latest version and we can't use it for the coffee machine

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:08.240
 configuration currently so this machine is built in 2017 um so quite new actually um i think those

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:15.920
 those machine types were introduced around 2015 or 16 and the screenshot you showed from we showed

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:23.920
 from the windows tool i think was one year before this machine appeared and if you look very long

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:31.360
 in the internet and we spent several hours looking for stuff for on these machines you can find it on

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:39.440
 some shady download grabbers grabber portals or whatever but we still haven't found a version

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:45.280
 where we can actually program this machine it's possible to program it over the the touch display

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:55.520
 but uh yeah you can take hours just for a single beverage so there's also some possible future work

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.640
 in this regards so there's also more possibilities for software analysis analysis we would like to

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:10.560
 obtain the programming software so if someone has something lying around you'll be happy to talk

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.240
 with you or if you know somebody who knows somebody who works at a coffee vending company maybe

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.000
 um i still want to understand how the boot procedure works because there are two different

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.720
 binaries and i couldn't trace how they know if the flash drive is plugged in everything it's still a

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:37.200
 ongoing um research for me so if you want to help out or interesting more for a machine

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:48.320
 talk to us ping us um and we have two more interesting things so um there is rfc 2324 who

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:57.040
 knows it who has read it okay quite a lot of people um so i was playing around since a few

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.560
 years to actually implement it on a coffee machine and then this machine came around and i said hey

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:10.480
 finally um a machine that could run it but it turns out it's a bit more difficult and actually

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:19.920
 while working on the machine and um looking at the rfc uh the coffee pot control protocol is really

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:27.600
 just more or less for coffee pots so classic coffee pots um espresso machines it's difficult

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:39.840
 also this machine can do also can make tea with tea powder and i've heard there is a specific type

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:48.160
 that it's not too bad um and also this one can actually also do a soup so there is soup powder

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:55.040
 um we don't have anything we don't have tea we don't have soup uh but uh because typically

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.400
 you have to take like 10 kilos of it and we don't want to risk to have 10 kilos of soup

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:08.640
 for this machine lying around um and maybe a new rfc extension for the coffee pot control

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:16.160
 protocol is needed for coffee pots and not tea pots for those machines too at least we have also

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.240
 crème brûlée as a powder flavor yeah we have crème brûlée

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:29.440
 it's quite tasty if you don't have too much powder in your in your coffee mug

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.480
 yeah it's uh it was a bit difficult to find the right dosage

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:43.760
 um well and there's of course the last question that everyone wants to know does it run doom

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:49.520
 and well i can say it can let's check it out

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:58.320
 uh

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:15.280
 there is uh actually a safety um switch here so that you can't operate the machine

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.760
 when it's turned on but you have to operate the machine when it's turned on to program it

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:29.440
 so there is a anti-safety key here that is here in the machine for maintenance

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.360
 and it's it actually switches completely switches off the power

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:47.840
 and programming the machines there is a there is a button uh inside of here or actually two buttons

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.840
 i'm not sure they do the same i'm not sure why uh they put in two buttons but i think uh this

00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:00.800
 plastic presses plastic presses on the first button and if you press it for a second then

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:08.320
 it will go into the program mode i'm still waiting until our management wi-fi hotspot uh

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.720
 turns on it's in the machine inside we added it so i can ssh into the machine

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:25.360
 and uh so even though the the serial protocol is quite weird and the setup is quite weird

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:32.880
 they i think they're actually quite nice machines um i think it's more the more of a management

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.360
 issue of the project that it turned out like this um because you could do a lot more with those

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:48.640
 electronics and um that's actually the board here is custom but there is a system on a board here

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:57.280
 um that's uh from uh very side so that's a vendor that uh supplies you with um linux

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.800
 arm linux boards where you can just run software and i think it's even running some kind

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:09.280
 of debian uh they publish on the site probably on the website probably a few years ago um

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:17.680
 you have an ethernet port here and there was no root password or anything um because yeah if

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.080
 you have the machine open you can do whatever you like and the root fs is completely on the sd card

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:29.920
 so um that's actually quite nice for swapping out the logos or trying out things uh you don't have

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:48.160
 to flash anything um you want i guess you

00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.160
 so um it has a touch display so it had to be done or it has a display so it had to be done

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:07.840
 we're running just a frame buffer doom although the machine itself is running x11

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.880
 which is fine um and

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:19.120
 we already in before we started to

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.280
 to look into the serial protocol and the software we thought like we could actually integrate

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.880
 those two parts that you can either switch between coffee mode and doom mode or actually

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:41.680
 implement a few things in doom where the coffee you get depends on your doom points

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:48.320
 and if you die just at the beginning you will just get hot water

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:57.360
 but that's still to do i need to kill the x11 search

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:16.080
 so a bit of um information on the machine itself all of those containers you can actually take out

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:26.480
 so um that's more or less empty currently for example um you can just take this out

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:37.920
 the motor plugs in into the rear here and operates the um the mechanism um for the uh powder and um

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.640
 it should also fit again

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:54.320
 ah yeah

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:03.520
 all right our demo failed i'm very sorry

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.320
 you can come to the village and we'll show it to you we're gonna fix it

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.480
 okay

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:26.080
 thank you very much for your presentation uh we are out of time but since uh you are so

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:33.840
 maybe uh tell everyone where exactly uh can can they find you um we are um more or less at the

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:41.520
 meta lab or lavendville village that's on the match is the village the village was the largest

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:50.640
 or the longest name and it's the silver or white dome basically right next to chaos west i think

00:42:50.640 --> 00:43:05.760
 chaos west probably is known by everybody thank you very much yeah thank you
