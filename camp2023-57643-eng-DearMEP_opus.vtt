 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 Now, it's my very great pleasure to give the word over for the talk,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 Dear MEP, Free Software Infrastructure for Online Campaigning in the EU.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 And please give a hand of applause to our speakers.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.480
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.600
 >> Thank you that you join us late at night.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 We are very happy that we can do a little bit of an introduction and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.920
 announcement to the free software that we are developing.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.800
 My name is Thomas Lohninger, I'm Executive Director of AP Center Works and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 the Boston Digital Rights Organization and also Vice President of EDGIE,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.800
 the umbrella of almost all digital rights NGOs working in the European Union.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.480
 And I'm here joined today with Tim Weber.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.840
 >> Right, I'm Tim or Sky.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.640
 I don't have as many titles, I'm a freelance software developer.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.520
 And I've been around this whole chaos family since 2005 or something like that.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 So yeah.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.200
 >> Great, yeah, let's get started.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.600
 There's a little bit of theoretical overview and then we will show you a preview.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.240
 And mind you that there is also access to the tool available for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.920
 everyone here at camp.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.680
 The URL will be announced later and we also had handouts.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.600
 But first let's explain a little bit why we are here.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320
 Can you turn to the next slide?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.360
 So what's the theory of change?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 Why are we doing this?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.120
 Our basic idea is that political decisions worsen when politicians are left alone.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.840
 Particularly with difficult things like internet regulation.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.080
 Technology regulation is inherently difficult.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.160
 And we believe that our community, that the hacker community,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 that people that are actually living in the internet have important things to say.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.040
 And that in today's world, particularly young people and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 people that are very much connected with the internet should be heard

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.920
 when politicians are making laws about technology and about the internet.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.040
 And our tool tries to bridge that divide.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.840
 Our tool tries to connect citizens and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.200
 average users with their political decision makers.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.160
 In our case, members of the European Parliament, MEPs, so those people that we

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.000
 elect every four years that sit in the European Parliament in Brussels and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.240
 in Strasbourg and make these very important decisions.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.760
 And those 705 MEPs come from all countries of the EU.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.400
 Those people are elected by us.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.600
 They should be accountable to us.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 And in the way the European Union works, whenever a law is made,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.720
 the parliamentarians have their say.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.880
 And there is a complex system between Brussels and Strasbourg and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.320
 various committees where every law has to be voted on various stages until you have

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.280
 a final piece of text that is the official position of the European Parliament.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.760
 And it doesn't matter if you go back to the softer patterns from the 90s or

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.720
 the GDPR or net neutrality copyright.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.400
 It is always the case that we usually have our best chance to adhere to civil

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 rights, to enshrine fundamental rights in the law with those 705

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.040
 members of European Parliament.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.560
 Those are the people that we vote for, not some government officials from

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.880
 ministries, and that's why they are our best chance to have future proof

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.400
 legislation adopted for half a billion people in the biggest market in the world,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.720
 which is the EU.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.360
 And you know that the EU often sets global standards, so we really believe

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.800
 that we need to look closely for the quality of those decisions.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.520
 And what we did in the past, in 2013-14, with safetyinternet.eu,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.520
 was that we sent faxes to the members of the European Parliament.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.320
 Back then, it was the beautiful case that when you send a fax to an MEP,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.960
 they all have their office, they all have their staff, it's a physical office

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.880
 they have, and in there is a multifunctional printer.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.400
 And when you send a fax to that printer, it gets printed out on paper.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 And you cannot disconnect the fax without also disconnecting the printer.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.480
 So we hacked that, basically, for net neutrality back then.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.320
 And so many trees were killed in the process.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.320
 I have to say.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.520
 But this was really efficient.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.000
 I still remember the stories from liberal politicians,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.960
 FDP from Germany, where the politician was really not our friend.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.520
 But because every morning, he had a pile of paper on his desk

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.440
 from citizens that wanted to have their opinion heard by this politician.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.640
 And the staffers really had this pile of paper every day,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.560
 so they couldn't ignore the citizens' opinion.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.720
 And that's also one of the reasons why we won Infrastreeding

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.200
 in the European Parliament for Net Neutrality.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.160
 And then we continued on.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.720
 You all remember upload filters, Article 13 in the copyright directive.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.400
 And back in 2019, we did a similar campaign.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.880
 But because we were so successful with the faxes,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.760
 faxes are no longer available in the printer.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.640
 They are now received in Outlook.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.000
 That means they are also in the spam filter.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.520
 They are no longer a viable way to reach the politician.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.560
 Telephone still is.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.600
 And in a very hasty campaign in 2019, we actually developed a call tool

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.160
 where people could call their members of European Parliament,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.520
 not just once, but also having a call subscription,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.240
 where every day you would be connected to the same politician from your country.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.880
 And it was a way for us to really make a difference.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.800
 Even allies of ours, like Marit De Schaake from the Liberal Dutch Party,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.680
 D66, said that was really helpful, but never do it again.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.400
 Because whenever we were in the office, the phone was ringing.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.680
 And whenever you are done with that one citizen, the phone would ring again.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.960
 So that was a very efficient way to reach parliamentarians in 2019.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.000
 But sadly, that software was a really ugly piece of thing

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 that we just developed hastily.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.320
 And it's not usable.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.000
 It was never open source because it wouldn't be something

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.120
 that's stable, usable for many campaigns.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.000
 And that's why we created DRMEP.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.240
 The basic premise of this tool is that, yes, this will be disturbing.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.040
 Yes, politicians would rather prefer being left alone

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.200
 with their power without hearing from their constituency.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.360
 But we believe it's time that they are accountable to their citizens

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.520
 and that they need to listen to the opinions from experts.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.680
 And we all are experts here in the room.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.160
 When it comes to technology, I think all of us have valuable things

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.320
 to contribute to this difficult problem of regulation of tech.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.480
 And these tools that we are developing here are commonplace in the US.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.920
 You have many tools that call Congress is one example.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.720
 In the UK, this is very common that you get connected with your member

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.000
 of parliament in the House of Commons.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.720
 In the EU, this is really not something that's done.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.880
 And we would like to fill that gap.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.640
 And one thing that we do here is not just to offer a phone tool

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.320
 that makes it very easy to connect with politicians.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.440
 We are also focusing on the movable middle.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.280
 In every political decision, there is a side that you've already won.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.360
 Like, let's take chat control.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.800
 You don't need to convince Patrick Breyer from the pirate party.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.680
 He is already on our side.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.600
 You will also never convince Axel Frost from the CDU, from the conservatives.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.680
 What you have to focus on, if you really want to get a majority,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.960
 is to focus on the movable middle, on those politicians that are yet left

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.640
 undecided, that can still be convinced with good arguments.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.840
 If they hear from people in their own language that truly care

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.760
 about the issue they have to vote upon, we believe that focusing

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.920
 on that movable middle with giving people a voice is a great way

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.600
 to actually increase the quality of the laws that get adopted.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.800
 And so to sum things up, what we try to solve with this tool

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.160
 is to really make it easy for users to engage with the EU.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.640
 The EU is a difficult beast.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.760
 There is process, there is trust books, there are 705 MEPs.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.320
 You really have a hard time trying to even get your opinion

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.680
 to the person that could theoretically vote on this.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.040
 And so we try to abstract everything that concerns the EU machinery.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.200
 You only need to care about the issue and make your own voice heard.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.720
 Of course, if you do international calls, they should usually be a cost.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.040
 Particularly if you do this seriously, there could be roaming charges

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.760
 depending on the price of your mobile phone contract.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.920
 That will not be the case with our tool, because we call the user.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.320
 There is no cost at all for a citizen.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.320
 We believe that we have an obligation as providers of this tool

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.040
 to really maximise the time that people are donating.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.120
 The users are volunteers, they don't get paid for that.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.720
 They care about something.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.200
 And really making the most out of the 20, 15, 30 minutes a week

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.400
 that they want to contribute for an issue is our obligation.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.200
 And that's why we try to maximise the impact from every phone call.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.480
 As I said, don't call us, we call you.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.640
 And most importantly, and that's the difference to the copyright campaign

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.920
 we did in 2019, this is a white label solution.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.840
 So it will be usable for these rights campaigns, but also for climate,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.120
 for migration issues, for any issue that people care about.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.280
 And that's also why we released the software under a GPL license,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.040
 because it's our belief that the path to parliament

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.320
 should be as long or as short for everybody.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.120
 In a democracy, everybody should have equality

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.000
 when it comes to influencing politicians and decision makers.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.280
 And I think that's, yeah, there's also concept note.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.760
 We haven't published this yet, but that's freely available

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.000
 for people that want to engage.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.560
 It gives a good outline of what we try to achieve,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.200
 what also future development steps would be.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.840
 But let's leave it at the theoretical level,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.160
 and I would love to show you the demonstration

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.600
 of the tool that we already have.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.280
 Right, yeah, so that's the demo.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.360
 So this is where things can actually go wrong, right?

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.040
 So as you can see, I'll just...

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.480
 We have handouts for the people who are there.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.000
 That's the URL, it's live right now.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.080
 It's chatcontrol.dermep.eu.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.360
 Just a small announcement, this is live and accessible for the camp right now.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.080
 We will probably, like, password protect it later on at some point.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.320
 So if you're watching a recording of this and you can't access the site,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.400
 yeah, then it's over.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.360
 So what you see here is basically the page you're seeing

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.320
 when you first open the tool.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.400
 You can switch the language.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.680
 So right now we have it available in German, English, and Swedish.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.920
 And as I said, here's where things go wrong, right?

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.320
 Let me just refresh this real quick.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.800
 Let's hope we have an internet connection here.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.840
 Internet conferences are prone to weak internet connection.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.040
 But the thing is, I have a local instance running as well,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.000
 so I can just use that, right?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.040
 OK, so yeah, you can switch the language,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.720
 and also there's a geolocation built in.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.280
 So whenever you access the site for the first time,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.400
 it will detect which country you are coming from.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.040
 This is all done without third-party services,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.240
 so we really focus a lot on privacy here.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.120
 So you can see there's a lot of countries in the EU,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.760
 and I can simply say, OK, I'm from the Netherlands,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:43.600
 and it will suggest a member of parliament from there to me.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.720
 So this is basically what the system thinks that...

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080
 or one of the persons that the system thinks

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.520
 that would be beneficial to call.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.320
 If you don't like calling this particular person,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.800
 you can always press this refresh button,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.080
 and it will suggest someone different.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.200
 But you can also say, if you like...

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.640
 You can also use the search function right now.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.280
 If you just click it, it will show you every MEP from the Netherlands,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.640
 but you can also search for your favorite politician

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.080
 or something like that.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.640
 And just select that one.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.200
 So we also have here a lot of social media profiles

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.160
 and other ways to contact these persons.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560
 Also, the phone numbers, for example,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.080
 there's a calendar built in

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.360
 because they switch between Brussels and Strasbourg.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.800
 So the system will always give you the right number

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.200
 for where they are right now.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.040
 And, yeah, if I just have this person,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.560
 I would...

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.640
 If I want to call Axel Forze right now,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.240
 I could say, "Call now."

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240
 So...

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.840
 And here we are at the point

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.480
 where you have to give us your phone number.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.760
 That's the only piece of identification from you that we get.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.800
 And, I mean, without your phone number, we can't connect you,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.280
 so that's fair game, I think.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.680
 So it just enters some kind of phone number.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.960
 And I...

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.520
 Yes, I have read and accepted the privacy policy.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.120
 By the way, we already have a working privacy policy

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.720
 if you're interested in that.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.520
 And...

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.200
 So it's...

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.840
 I click it, it sends me a code on my mobile phone.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.200
 "Oh, yeah, all right, my code is...

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.960
 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, of course."

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.840
 And...

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.200
 I verify this. So, yeah.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.840
 We are now successfully verified with this number.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.320
 And we can now start a call.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.400
 So what would happen in this instance,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.000
 not right now,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 is that our phone would ring

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 and we would pick up the phone

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.520
 and some nice voice, maybe of Thomas or someone else,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.920
 would say, "OK, hi, this is DRMEP.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.440
 "Would you like to be connected to Axle Force?"

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.360
 And then you could, like, press 1 or 2 or something like that,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.720
 and you would be connected to the office of Axle Force.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.240
 So let's click Start Call,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.160
 and we'll call you right away.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.120
 And as you can see, there are talking points right here.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.760
 So ignore this for a moment.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.280
 This is just the mock-up.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.480
 So this is already showing what you would see

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.200
 if the call were over.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.000
 So we have a lot of talking points

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.840
 which you can scroll through during your call

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.960
 to aid you in...

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.600
 Yeah.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.640
 In talking to the person.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.000
 And after the call,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.840
 you are able to give some feedback,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.920
 like, "Were you able to convince the person?"

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.440
 Let's click Yes with Axle Force. Come on, let's say.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.560
 Axle Force voted against...

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:53.840
 ..terminology, like, the thing that just reclassified

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.360
 "call power" as green.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.520
 He was actually with Fridays for Future.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.640
 So Axle Force is convincing on some issues.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.480
 Let's not give hope up on it.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.240
 And the beauty of that here is that, of course,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.920
 the system is learning.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.640
 If enough people have said,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.280
 "Yeah, I have convinced this politician,"

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.120
 they will actually move to the green corner

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.400
 and be out of the movable middle.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.160
 So the system is actually learning.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.560
 You don't need to divide up with Axle Sheets,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.160
 the members of parliament.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.120
 Everybody can just use that tool.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.440
 And you are always connected to the person

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.040
 who is most likely to be influenced,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.120
 who can make a difference,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.320
 and the system always learns

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.960
 from the users that are using it.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.400
 Right. So you can give additional feedback

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.000
 if you want to, and we just click "Submit".

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.480
 So we're back on the page.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.320
 We could instantly choose another person,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.120
 and let's show us the second feature.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.000
 We can also call later.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.840
 So what's "call later"?

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.000
 Call later allows you to enter a schedule.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.360
 Maybe you're like, "OK, I have time each Tuesday

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.720
 at around, I don't know, 13.30 to talk to a politician,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.480
 because that's right after my lunch break.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.440
 I am in a good mood,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.680
 and I would like to talk to a politician.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.040
 And on Thursday, my lunch break is basically on 1 o'clock

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.160
 or something like that.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.480
 So you can enter different times for different workdays,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.080
 or you can just leave it like that,

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.160
 and you can say "Confirm", and basically that's it.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.400
 So what would happen right now is the system would call you

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.240
 on Tuesday at 13.30 or around 13.30,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.920
 and ask you, "Do you have time right now?

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.800
 Do you want to be connected to Berg Lars Patrik?"

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.040
 And yeah.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.880
 And the reason for that is that we know that,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.960
 particularly for nerds, maybe for everybody,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.880
 speaking with foreign people is not easy.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.120
 We know that this is a high ask, that actually picking up the phone,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.360
 speaking with politicians is a big favour we're asking from people.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.120
 But those people that are willing to do this once,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.200
 most likely will do it again.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.560
 And by maximising this slow conversion rate of those people

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.960
 that truly care, that we want to speak with their parliamentarian,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.400
 and letting them do it again, maybe get really good at it,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 that's also a beauty of this talk.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.560
 Again, we are nudging people, whenever we call you,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.440
 there will be the option "Press 9" and the subscription is cancelled.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.920
 And as I said, there's a privacy policy already in place,

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.000
 the GDPR compliant, yes, we adhere to the law,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.720
 and we are very strict with the data that we process.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.640
 Most phone numbers are hashed and encrypted,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.240
 only in active call subscriptions where we need the number to connect to,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.560
 then we have it actually in the database.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.640
 But we try to be as privacy preserving and minimalistic as possible with all of that.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.240
 And as we are out of time, I'd just briefly like to say before I go to Q&A,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.200
 that this tool right now will be applied for the chat control campaign,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.680
 we are still in development, we are also here to talk with the community,

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.200
 to get your feedback and your input, maybe also get some help

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.080
 with testing, penetration testing, development and so forth.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.040
 But at this stage, it's really something that we, after chat control has passed,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.720
 hope to release in this HPPL license, that we have something that's forever truly available

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.960
 for the community to engage with MVPs.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.520
 Thank you.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:51.840
 Thank you so much for your talk.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:20:04.240
 So, we have decided beforehand that you are going to do the Q&A offline outside of the tent,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.080
 because we are out of time here for this stage,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.280
 but these two speakers will still be available for your questions,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:23.960
 just we won't be using our kind angel team back there for the technology there.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.680
 So, thank you all for coming here.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.880
 Please give another round of applause to our speakers.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.980
