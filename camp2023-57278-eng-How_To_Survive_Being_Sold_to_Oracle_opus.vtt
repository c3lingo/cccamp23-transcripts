00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 So the next talk is about ancient history, or at least ancient history as far as computers are concerned.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 A long, long time ago there was a company called Sun Microsystems,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 and then they got bored by Oracle, and that destroyed a lot of great hardware,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 but it also destroyed, or nearly destroyed, an interesting code base.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 The code base that in the end became LibreOffice.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Torsten and Bjorn are here to tell you about what happens when your code base gets bought by a huge giant IT code base.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 How the code base gets bought by a huge giant IT company, and how you survive that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 It's actually about being bought by Lawn Mower, as the saying goes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So the company with the mission of destroying open source projects.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 I think we've now snipe you into actually attending a talk about a bit of a history of open office and LibreOffice.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Welcome everyone.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So a quick introduction, who's talking today.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 First of all, me. My name is Torsten.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I've been with the open office project for, I don't know, more than 20 years.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 So I started at Sun.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 I got out before Oracle bought the company. I was then working for SUSE Linux,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 and I was working for another company who was serving the Linux project for the city of Munich.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I founded my own company some three years ago, and I'm still happily contributing and working on the old code base that used to be open office.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 It's now called LibreOffice.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And the great thing about open source is that you can change your job and take your work with you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Yeah, hi. I'm Bjorn. That's me.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 And I joined the open office team at Sun in 2008, and I was a very happy camper back then because I was in Sun.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 That was wonderful.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And then this evil empire bought them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And yeah, so shortly after LibreOffice was founded, and I quickly did exactly what Torsten said.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 I did the same job just for a different company, namely Canonical, and started with working on LibreOffice shortly after.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 And I became a member of the board.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I, from the start, when we founded the foundation behind LibreOffice, just like Torsten,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 and I even stayed on the board after I quit the job at Canonical and was only a volunteer contributor to LibreOffice,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 where I was just hacking in the evening in my free time.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 OK, so I heard that people are slightly exhausted from the heat and everything, and there are lots of great talks, and now there's this here.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 So we thought we make this a little bit more interactive.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 So if you have lots of questions, ask them during the talk.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Like, there comes a slide, you have a question or you have a comment.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Make it. We will come running around with a microphone.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 There will be time for questions afterwards, but not that much.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So first question. Who has been affiliated or working with one of the many projects that Oracle asked?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Yay. One, two, three, at least. Four, five.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 That's a decent number. OK, so let's start with some how to bootstrap out of Oracle's grip.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So, bit of history. Well, the codebase is ancient.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Well, not that ancient. The idea is from 1985 when there was a DOS application.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 But the actual codebase is from 1990, literally the first commit in that old codebase is from, I think, March 1990.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 So it's really quite ancient. C++ timeline overall.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So OpenOffice started in 2000. So that's also 23 years ago.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 There was lots of like tiny little forks or semi-forks over the time of that codebase.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 So, and quite relevant. I might be biased there, but it's one of the largest open source projects still around.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 It was a great thing that Sun back in the day open sourced it almost, I think, as significant as Netscape open sourcing Mozilla and that codebase.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Yeah, so history, whatever. Sun releases that. Some changes there on license.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 So the first license was relatively commercially friendly. So IBM at the time took the opportunity to fork that internally and not contribute back.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 So for the project of that size and that relevance, I do believe that license matters.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And in this case, Sun agreed and changed the license to LGPL, which actually then requires contributing back.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And then sadly, they cut a side deal with IBM. So IBM could continue to use the proprietary version under a special license, which in the end, community members didn't like that much.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 So pretty much from not from day one, but probably from 2004 or 2005, there was some unhappiness in the community.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 There was also some promises for an independent open office foundation that never came to pass. So there was some bit of grumbling there.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 And of course, the project itself was very single vendor. So there was Sun and then there was a very large gap to the next contributor in terms of size.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 And then again, it was very successful in gaining traction and gaining support and being ported to any number of platforms.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Yeah, last major release was 2008. And then this happened.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 So there was this announcement that Sun was not doing well for a number of reasons and there was a number of companies being paraded as potential bidders.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And in the end, Oracle was outbidding everybody else. And that pretty much from day one was causing concerns.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 So Oracle was known already at the time to be very bottom line focused.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 It was very obvious at a time with a staff of more than 100, I think, 100, 10, 120 people at the Sun Microsystems open office team.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 That was looked pretty unsustainable under Oracle rule.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 So I think at least in, I think, late 2009, early 2010, all over the world, community people started looking into serious looking into what are we going to do.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So there was already kind of community support and communication channels being axed and being increasingly hard to get someone to commit to something inside the open office team.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 So the writing was essentially on the wall. What's going to happen?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 There was a history of Oracle. There was other open source projects that were under some maintainership that had similar concerns.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 I think at the time when early 2010 already one was already, I think, under in serious peril.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So, yeah, so overall people started to be concerned and started to think about what to do.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And I think this is one of the first ingredients that you need if you want to try and break away.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 You need critical mass. You need critical mass at the end for users to matter.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 But first of all, you need the critical mass of people, of contributors that matter.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 If you don't have that, probably don't do it yet.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So there was the time before 2009, there was some people who were considering putting some pressure on Sun or going at their own.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 I think ultimately probably all of those opportunities, all of those attempts would have failed because, as I said, you need a critical mass of contributors.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 You need most of the core contributors for something like LibreOffice or Firefox or something else.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 You need a number of knowledgeable people who can actually maintain your code base. Otherwise, don't do it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 So that was suddenly there was this opportunity. So there was a way with lots of people in the community being concerned.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 That's an ingredient number one.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 One example question I would like to ask the audience. Who here knows and uses Hudson CI?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Example.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Who uses Jenkins or knows about Jenkins?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Okay, Jenkins is just Hudson without the trademark name because Hudson was a project by a Sun employee who did that mostly in their free time.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And they fired him, if I remember correctly, and afterwards told him, your project has to do this, that, and this, and that, those ways after they fired him.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Otherwise, you can't use our trademark.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And then Hudson became your name, which was Jenkins. So that was a bit of a foreshadowing for things to come.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Right. So and that's the second ingredient. So if you are end user focused, you bloody need a name.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 And if you don't have a name, you very quickly need to make your name.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So and then there was another one of the problems that actually Sun at the time and then Oracle held the trademark rights for open office.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So that was out. Right. So that caused quite some headache and some planning there.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 So you need critical mass. You need a name.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And you need something actually that people can, at the day when you announce that, you need something actually there.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 You need some some bits and binaries to download.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 So all of that taken together.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 What happened then was that all those people around the world were coming together.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It was very conveniently.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 There was a very last open office conference in September 2010, and everybody was there anyway.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And it was my first conference.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 And I was very happy to be there and be at this huge event. It was my first open office conference.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 And these guys did other things than talking about open office.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Yes, so we wanted to meet like privately, but it was this kind of Oracle run event.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 So we all had a stomach ache one evening and we didn't go for the river cruise.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 But everybody like surprisingly, everybody had a stomach ache. There was nothing wrong with the food.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 But we all came up with the same excuse.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 We met in Budapest for some conspirative dinner and hashed out and hashed out the not the final supper.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 You know that I'm not in there.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 I didn't know, well, except for everyone having a stomach ache, I didn't know about what they were doing.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 But clearly they were doing something.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So we actually we hashed out that so we launched on September 27.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 So there was like looking each other into the eye and like committing to it.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Like, yeah, we're going to do that.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 And we had people from Linux distributions.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 We had lots of volunteers there.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 We had quite some critical mass, I would say, at the time.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And we sat there for dinner, had some good meal and some wine.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 And we looked each other in the eye and said, yeah, we're going to do that.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 We go live and then prepared everything like, yeah, whatever.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Lots of nights hacked and websites prepared and downloads and binaries prepared.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And we set up a mirror system so that when we hit the go button, that we wouldn't like,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 I don't know, all those 20 people start downloading liberal office,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 that the mirror infrastructure wouldn't actually break down.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It wasn't more than 20 actually.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 It might quite a splash.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 So that's probably so when you have critical mass,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 probably you have some people with some marketing experience, with some press contacts.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And for something where you need to make your name, that's the fourth ingredient that really matters.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 So from day one, you have to be in the press for a while because nobody knows you.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So people need to read about you for a little while.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Right. So we went on.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 And we actually asked ourselves the question, is this a dot?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 So is this going to fly or not?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And of course not.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 It's a fork and a successful one.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 So yeah, we went on, announced, went live, had some, I think, I don't know, some,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 I think the first month, I don't know, I don't have that number,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 but it was not shy of a million, not much lower than a million downloads, I think, in the first month.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And for something end user, like give the people something to play with.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Okay. Going on.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I'm going to speed this up a little bit.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So anybody remembers those days?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 So we actually were quite lucky.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Like everybody remembers like Heizer writing about that?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah, that's great.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 So I think that's super, super lucky there.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And of course it was like fitting the narrative like Oracle bad.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And so it was kind of helpful to be at that moment.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 But that's probably the fifth ingredient.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Like use the moment.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 You will know when the moment has come and then jump and don't hesitate.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Just fucking do it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Right. So then, well, actually then we did it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 And then actually the problem started and the work started.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 So before that was all kind of theorizing.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 But then actually we had to start working.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 And we had to change from something that was sun funded, sun promoted, sun owned,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 and then Oracle owned, to something that was completely community run.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 So from this umbrella, there's someone holding the umbrella and paying the bills

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 to something where you actually are thrown into the cold water and you have to run it yourself.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And trying to actually make a difference and using this momentum that we had from that day.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And the momentum was actually also on the development side.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 That was essentially 10 years of pent up demand when people wanted to change something

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 and sunset, no, whatever.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And our engineering quality standards prohibit us from doing this.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 So, yeah, I don't know.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Sun was kind of still a bit corporate and this was community and people just wanted to break free and hack.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And that's what they did.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Right. So that's a bit of the commit history there.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So you see there's some pretty much coming up from zero.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 The blue top there, that's Oracle.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Open office committers.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 There's almost nothing else when we started.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 So almost all development was actually done by sun engineers, Oracle engineers.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And then you see this explosion, this Cambrian explosion there of people starting to contribute.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 You see Christmas, that's when people take a break.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 But it recovers from there on.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Yeah. So lots of things that we did that led us to being on every Linux distribution,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 that led to trade press likes us because we had lots of feature releases that could write something about us.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 This release train thing is quite important to actually lay a different foundation for the community or the contributors

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 because in the release train, everyone has like the same influence on when something is released.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Namely, not at all because it will be released by a specific time.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And at Sun Oracle, it was always, yeah, I spoke to a release engineer once at Sun and he said,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 "Well, I always take vacation on the release date because I know that it's not going to be released on that date.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So because it would always be delayed."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 So there was a privilege in Sun Oracle to set the release date at whatever they wanted.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And all the others didn't have any influence.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 And the release train actually made all contributors equal and their influence equal.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 You had to get your feature in by a specific date and if not, well, then in the next release in half a year

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 or in a feature fix release just like everyone else.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So there was no special treatment there. That's quite important actually.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And then Oracle threw us a curve ball, that one there.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 So they shut down the open office team and contributed the project to the community,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 which had already moved on.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So they found another community to contribute that to and donated it to the Apache Foundation.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 The upside of that was that LibreOffice could relicense.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 So the code was then suddenly available under the Apache license.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Also Oracle had fired everyone working in there.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Like everyone that was working on open office.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Just five people were rehired by IBM.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 But that's just a side note.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So they donated the project after firing everyone.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Right, they fired everyone and then they donated the project.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 So I think in hindsight we did the right thing with forking.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Of course it would have been nicer to agree beforehand so there wouldn't be two competing projects.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 Hard to say.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Alternative histories.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 I don't know.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 So as I said, the upside, and there are quite some upsides, is that LibreOffice could relicense.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And so we are now under MPL, which is slightly better, we think,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 from how LibreOffice, with extensions and everything, is built.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 So it's slightly more business friendly.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 So if you add a file, you have to open source that file.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 In MPL it's like you change the file you have to publish.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And if you add something like new files and functionality, then in theory you can keep that proprietary.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So there are upsides.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And of course the open office project, there's lots of friendly people there that we meet frequently at conferences.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 But of course at the time it was quite a problem.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Because then of course there's this, well there's now two projects.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So who's the trade press going to celebrate?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 And who are the, like, if you want to hack an open source office suite, where are you going to go?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 I think in the end that turned out quite alright.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 So if you look at the contributors, this is a scientific paper that had a bit of a look there.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 You see quite some overlap.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 So you actually see people committing on both ends.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 But you also see how relatively small that is.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And for something as 10 million lines of code or 8 million lines depending on how you count,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 of course number of committers actually matters to make a difference.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 So in the end it was mostly this where we ended up.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 I think both places have a point.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Of course having some nice solar roof is nice.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 I like to be living on that side.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 And finally, and then I will hand over to Björn with a bit of take home messages

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 and actually actionable content like what to take for your own projects if you want to fork.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 So we had this little foundation thing there.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 So we actually promised to have a foundation.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And someone said foundation in German means Stiftung, so let's have Stiftung.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 And actually that was, nobody ever did that.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 So we had to figure out how to do that.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And we did it in Berlin, which is cool.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Berlin, I love them.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 It just took a while.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Also, the lawyer you see there, we can make him an honorary hacker

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 because he made Stiftung to be something that was never done before.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Namely that its leadership is democratically elected by the contributors.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 No one ever did that.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And Berlin was very, huh, what's that?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 When that came up.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Berlin was like, what's that?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Well, actually, why not?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Yeah, but it was something very new and done the first time there.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Right, so there's lots and lots of things to say about that foundation thing, but I'm not.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 If you are curious, hit me up after the talk.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So let's hand over, so there's lots and lots and lots of numbers and lots of conferences.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 And actually the project is actually going strong and growing, which is just awesome to be a part of.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 It's now actually able to attract about one and a half million euro of donations a year.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 And with that, able to sustain a substantial number of people, both like hired staff that run the foundation

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 and that run the infrastructure and that run the bills and releases and do mentoring and all of that.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 And also like to fund development, both with internal developers and with tenders, like tendering that to the ecosystem.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Right, and that's that bit. Any questions so far?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Just out of interest, did any of you work on Star Office?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Maybe 4.0 or something?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Because Star Office was always a product, like there was always this, there was single vendor open source.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 You had open office and then you had the proprietary version of that, dual license if you will.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 So Sun had a contributor license or copyright assignment.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 So they were able to sell Star Office under proprietary terms and did that till the last day.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Yeah, I did so too. And it was wonderfully harder to build because it didn't have open source contributors

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 making the build even easier back then. And LibreOffice made it a lot more easy for people to actually contribute.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 So open office was already hard, but Star Office was way harder to use.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Because it was internal and we can't treat our developers like that.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Yeah, I don't know. I think many of you are working on software.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 So do you agree with that difference between if it's open source and you get contributors, actually making things easy and nice and fun matters,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 but internal projects somehow not. Is that generally the case?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Yeah.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Yeah, yeah. It's interesting. So it's great to have one of those great things with open source.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So go contribute to open source. The fun is there.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 All right. So let's go to the boilerplate and some stuff you might find interesting, horrifying and whatever when you start a fork.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Like licenses, ownership and CLAs, contributor license agreements, codes of conduct, brands, statutes and donations.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 So what of these things are important? Is it important to have a license?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 General agreement in the audience. Is it important which OZ approved license you choose?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 I would say not so much actually as who owns the code.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 For example, if you have to contribute all your code to one company or one entity, they can change the license.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 And well, HashiCorp did that recently, like last week with Terraform.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 In that case, the license isn't that important because if you're not owning it anyway, they can change it at any time.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 So yes, it's important to have an OZ approved license. Which one is not that important?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So just choose one of the OZ approved ones.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Yeah, I think that's really one of the many take home messages. Go with Borg standard stuff.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Don't reinvent anything that does not matter for what you really can do, which is hacking on code.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 So run with one of the three most prominent OZ approved licenses.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Which one actually does not matter that much if you want to fork?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Probably you can't change the license anyway, so just run with the license you've got.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 So in hindsight, we had this discussion in 2010.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 In hindsight, I don't think the license fundamentally matters, except for the case that, of course, your project needs to agree.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So it's more like the underlying basement, like how your community interacts.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Like if I contribute code, what am I getting back? What are others getting out of it?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So in a sense it matters, but not greatly. What matters is not alienating your contributors.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 In that way it does matter.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 And going beyond that, what is true for the license is even more true for the code of conduct.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 If you want to write your own, your contributors will spend two years fighting each other, hating each other in the end,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 and not talking to each other and not coding.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 So just take one of the existing code of conducts and use that.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 The importance is really to execute on what is in the code of conduct and not each single word in the code of conduct.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Brands and donations, that's also quite important.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 If you want to have donations or if you want to have money or users, then the brands are important.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Because when Liber Office started, well I say we, you, you had the contributors from the first day.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 I was joining half a year later.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 But the users, there are still lots of people using OpenOffice, even though it's like there's not even a cow to ride on anymore.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 It's so dead, or a horse to ride on.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 So brands are really important if you depend on the users in some formal way.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And that's surprising.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 I mean, I don't know, so as a geeky person, I would always like, why does it matter?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I mean, why do I care how the thing is called?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Is it bleedingly obvious that this gets more contribution than that?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 So I'm going for that.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 But of course, if you're end user focus, that doesn't work.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 So I mean, I don't know if you make the experience as well, how strong brands are and how much that matters.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Once you have an established brand, you're up against.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 But don't underestimate that.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Also the longevity.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 So OpenOffice is still getting, I don't know, a million downloads or something a month.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Okay, let's go on.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 So we have this wonderful title, an aging organization.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 We fought ten years ago.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 So what did we learn?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 So let's quickly go to the next slide.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Ten years ago, roughly, we set sail and everyone was agreeing on which direction to go.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 And it was roughly something like this.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Yeah, we want to promote open source and should be free.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 This is actually the English translation.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 It says free of charge.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 The German one says freie Nutzung, which is not explicitly free of charge.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 So there's already some things in there that might be misunderstood or understood differently for different people.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And how many of these are the words that you can have epic discussions ten years after about?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 And the interpretation of these words, everyone agrees on the sentence that was there in the beginning, but not everyone agrees on what they mean.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And that might actually, that means that it's really important to get a shared understanding what you're aiming for.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And still have that renegotiated if the environment changes, if something like cloud productivity becomes a thing and so on.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 All right.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 So what should you take care of when you do something like that?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 You built the ship of TSLS and you exchange things on the deck.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Well, the things you should quickly exchange is, I don't know if you can see that, but it's technology and being able to work in different environments.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 You should also not always like directors like me should not stay on the board for eight years and like you not for longer.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 But that's, we kind of had the problem that we don't have enough candidates.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 But still, you should exchange people and there should not be single points of failure and people being like having power just for their role.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 But the things that should be internal should be principles like do as decide.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Freedom is important like freedom in freedom as in beer or freedom as in freedom.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 That you fight lock in and monopolies and that you want to have your project sustainable and open and diverse and things like that.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 And we did not succeed in everything we say there.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 I mean, there are two white guys standing on the stage here.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 But still, it's important to have the principles to be there and everyone having a shared understanding about them and being flexible about the rest.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 The stuff that is more to the right.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Yeah, and quite indeed.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 And that's like for longer term projects, the only constant is change.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 So make sure you can change.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 There was a bit of a problem, there is a bit of a problem because some things can't easily be changed for a number of reasons.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Once you've set sail and went on.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 So the ship of thesioids is a great metaphor.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Just that you can't change anything that is below the water line.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And that's quite a lot for liberal office.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Yeah.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 So what you get is you have a vision, a mission, something where you want to get to. And then you have holographic superpositions, which is what everyone thinks everyone else agrees upon.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 But maybe not everyone is agreeing on.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 So how can that look like?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 And I have one example.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 The next slide is not by me.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 It's by Italo who does liberal office marketing.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Awesome guy.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And it shows you like how the liberal office project has different strata strata of people like the core people are people who are being paid to work on that or are working on it as if they were being paid.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 That's a cough.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Maybe 40 people.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 And then there are regular volunteers and occasional volunteers and a whole lot of people who are not in here.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 People doing user experience, QA, translations and stuff like that.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 So there's different things.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And everyone has different perspectives on this.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 And I want to give you like the comic version of can you give me the next?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 The comic version of a developer point of view, which incidentally might coincide with my view when I'm unconstrained by being on the board and just talking for myself.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 And that might be the most important part is the project.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 I want to win new contributors, more people who develop on the code.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 I want to have innovation.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 I want to build new things.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 I want to have liberal office like Google office in the cloud and stuff like that.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 I want it to be free as in freedom.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 That is everyone should be able to innovate on top of it.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And I want to have the business stuff that works on it to be actually in the product like someone building new things on liberal office itself.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Like below the line that is actually part of liberal office.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And then you have again a comic version of someone who might be further apart from the developer perspective.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And that is something like, yeah, I want to have more users.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 For example, this is a perspective of someone who's doing trainings for liberal office.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Then obviously that is very important.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And the corporate actually doesn't need to change that much.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 It might just be well enough to just be well maintained and get security fixes and stuff like that.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 It needs to be free as in beer.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 That is should not be like cost money.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 And the business cases are built on top of that.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 So I'll take liberal offices as an existing product.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 And I sell stuff on top of that.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 And in the end, next night, you want to have something like this.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 You want to have the community create more users from which you can recruit new contributors, which again makes the product better.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 And maybe even create new use cases for the product which creates more users and so on.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 So you should balance both of these perspectives.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 And in the Document Foundation, we have a democratic process where everyone votes and everyone has the same vote.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 But the thing is you have to balance these points of view.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And if you leave ten core developers in a room, they will come up with one perspective.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 But you always have to bring these perspectives together so that you are not having only one side of one view on the project and the product.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 So that's really a challenge that grows over the years with your community getting older and seeing more of these challenges.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 So this is the summary within one in the title.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 There are two things here.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 If you want to have users, actually the brand is really important.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 For getting users, LibreOffice as a brand is hugely important.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 For the contributors, the brand, you could fork tomorrow into something called something else, maybe Go-O-O or something.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And no one would care.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 But if you have a good brand name, that actually gets you the users.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 And if you care for the users, that's important.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 The same for the contributors in a different way.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Because for the contributors, the project is really important.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 What can I do?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 What are my options to grow in this thing?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Right.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 So this is essentially the essence of it.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 So I was listing five important things earlier in this talk.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 But many of them flow out of those two.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 You need a name. If you don't have a name, have the means to make a name.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Like make a big splash, make sure you get lots of attention.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 You need contributors, of course.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 So take your contributors with you.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 If you can't, be prepared for a rough ride or have some means to create a new community.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Those two are the most important things to have.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 If you don't have an answer to those two questions, don't fork.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Yes.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 Let me read that because it's, I think, not visible with the sun.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 Forking, we can help.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Come and ask us.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Thank you.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Thanks so much.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Thank you, Thorsten and Bern, for a great trip down memory lane,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 and also very practical information about open source projects and how to survive being borked.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Any questions?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Thank you.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Have you already thought, I mean, before you have thought that maybe OpenOffice would be the winner in the game?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 So I was at OpenOffice at the time, so I had no thoughts in that regard.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 You got to answer that one.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Yeah.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 As I said earlier, so this is hindsight 22.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 That's hypothetically maybe.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 It could have changed something.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 At the time, we were absolutely convinced that if this becomes known, that Oracle would play this divide and conquer game

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 and go to many corporate friends and say, well, your database licenses are priced like that,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 and maybe you want to change your mind so that they price the same tomorrow.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 So we're really, really afraid that they would pick out those like in particular corporate sponsors of the liberal office project from the early days

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 that actually contributed a lot of development resources that they would be not available or gone or sitting on the fence.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 But yeah, as I said, hard to say what would have happened.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Hello. Yeah. Did anyone stay in Oracle for long enough to actually make any friends there out of all the developers obviously been there for decades

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 and maybe tempt some of them over to the bright side?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 So I left on 1st of February. I was at Canonical. Six weeks later, everyone at Canonical was fired, at Oracle was fired.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 So a lot of those who were still with the company at the point that I left were there just for six more weeks, were not allowed to move over.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 And then Red had hired quite a few of them and they became quite valuable core developers in liberal office.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 But obviously we could not in the liberal office ecosystem like hire everyone who was just fired. We would have loved to mostly.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 But yeah. But actually we managed over the course of the years following.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 So we had to start from somewhere and that was quite constrained.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 But actually we managed over the course of the years to pick a few more from those former core developers down.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 And so I mean there is with Oracle, I mean so there are great people at Oracle to this very day and like very, very good open source people to this very day.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 So of course it's a bit of a black and white comic strip villain thing that we painted here and apologize for that. But it makes for great talk.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Yeah. Also it's a good idea to talk to Oracle people if they are at FOSDEM or something like that where you can talk about the projects and not about the company.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 And they might be more interested in like the things you share and not the things that like I mean don't make them defend their company. That doesn't help anyone.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Is there anyone working for Oracle here?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 One last question.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 So my question is in recent days there have been a lot of mutes from companies against open source projects.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 What is your take? How could these projects like how could open source be more, could be better for the company so that they share this common vision in the future?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Like how could this, so what incentives would you have to set? That's basically my question.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Well it's a bit tricky to see all of open source projects but I think you see quite a few of those projects that were open sourced and were closed sourced now or in some way moved towards that.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 It might have been always the plan of that company. If that's a venture capital company that wants to grow big that might always be the plan.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 Because open source is not a business model.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Yeah so the thing you need to do and this is what we were talking about here too and we had in the foundation statues is to make the project sustainable. And that means it needs to, also for the commercial entities, it needs to be relevant to be part of that.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 And there are actually very few projects who did that. Apart from LibreOffice I think Linux is one of the projects where it's really multiple contributors from all over the place.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 They all have very different use cases and that's why it works. So many people have so many use cases that their shared work is more valuable than if they would do their own thing.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 And you need to find that thing to make everyone have a shared interest in the thing.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 So open source helps tremendously for getting very, very widely distributed. Like ubiquitously distributed everywhere.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 It also helps attracting contributions if it's accessible, if it's well done. But it's not a business model.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 Yeah as Bjorn said some might think that for venture capital the idea was to get onto everybody's machine and then cash out.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 For LibreOffice we already had all of that there. So we had existing business models that could continue. We could fine tune that.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 We could find spots there. Of course we didn't need to feed 120 people which was sad at the time but it also made it slightly easier to keep things going and growing over the time.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Thanks a lot Torsten and Bjorn. Thanks for your insights. Let's give another round of applause for Torsten and Bjorn.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 [Applause]

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
