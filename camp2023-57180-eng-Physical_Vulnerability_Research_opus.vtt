00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Okay, all right, now I think you can hear me, right?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.400
 So welcome to the last talk of the day.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.680
 So it will be a talk where the physical security research gets really physical,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.480
 at parts at least.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.000
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 >> So please welcome Matt Smith for the talk.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.600
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.480
 >> All right, let's try this again, shall we?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.600
 Hopefully, we're not gonna have terrible weather tonight, so we'll see.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 Okay, so this is about physical vulnerability research and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.280
 some of the stuff that I've been up to.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 So I'm gonna go through the whole thing again, so it probably makes sense.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.040
 So if you've heard it before, I'm sorry.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 So anyway, a bit about me, I'm Matt Smith, otherwise known as Huxley Pig.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.320
 I've done a lot of social engineering throughout my life.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 I used to call it like blagging, getting stuff for free, getting in places for free.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.280
 And then when I got older, this legitimate term came along, yes,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 I'm a social engineer, yeah, great.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.320
 And it's making passes, that sort of thing, I don't work for Oxfam.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 Then I got a degree in computer science, software developer,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.920
 Skyder engineer.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.160
 And then I became a locksmith at first, the black hat, and then a white hat.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.280
 And now I make tools, this is Marsella, where I make the tools, lock fall towers.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.640
 And I look for things I like to call physical O days, so

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 that's exactly what it sounds like.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.160
 It's an undisclosed vulnerability in a physical system.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.360
 And now I also help a lot of lock makers improve their designs,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.120
 find problems with the locks.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.400
 And I've also got a couple of patents for locks I've designed now.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.600
 So if you're like me, you've always loved breaking shit,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.360
 that's why you're here, right?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.360
 One of the first things I hacked was Virgin Media to get free,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 it was nothing great, it was just getting free internet, but

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.080
 that was a lot of fun.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.000
 Locksmithing actually goes back seven generations in my family.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.400
 My great, great, great grandad started it.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 And eventually I fell into the same profession.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 I never wanted to be a locksmith when I was growing up, by the way.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.720
 I didn't want to do what my parents did, like everyone.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.520
 I wanted to be a software developer.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.440
 And then when I actually did it and sat down at a computer for hours and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.120
 hours and weeks on end, I thought, maybe not.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.040
 >> Maybe I don't want to do this.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.640
 So yeah, originally I was a black hat and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920
 I was stealing the money from vending machines, primarily.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.560
 Not the food, the money.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.520
 This is before contactless, so it was all change.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.040
 So you could find quite a lot of money in the busy ones.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.600
 But it's okay, I've changed now, so no more black hats, white hat now.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.360
 And I shouldn't have to say this, but

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 don't break into vending machines or parking meters.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.320
 I know a guy who got convicted for breaking into parking meters.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.520
 He wasn't picking the locks, he was forcing the locks, but

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.720
 he was definitely stealing the money.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.200
 And he got a five year injunction banning him from going near any parking meter,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.360
 unless it was at an airport, and he could do it for a maximum of ten minutes.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.240
 And then he couldn't return to the parking meter for a minimum of six hours.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.920
 And yeah, it could make life difficult, so don't do this.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.480
 Okay, so I'm gonna go through some stuff I've not released before,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.000
 not publicly at least, and go through some vulnerabilities that I've found,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.360
 and sort of how I managed to arrive at where I did.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.240
 And look for sort of common patterns and errors.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.280
 And this is applicable to digital security as well.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.120
 You get like vendors that'll use the same chipsets,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.240
 which have got badly implemented stacks, or bad pseudo random number generators,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.160
 and every vendor that uses that chipset, that device will be vulnerable.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.640
 And yeah, we'll try and apply some sort of framework to see if we can expedite it in

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.120
 the future.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.000
 I'm not going to be showing any sort of classified stuff, but

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.880
 if you want to chat to me in the bar later, buy me a beer,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.640
 we can talk about the fun stuff then.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.760
 Okay, so like I say, if you're like me,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.400
 you think security stuff exists to be broken, right?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400
 If it's meant to be secure, we want into it.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.520
 And this goes for lots of people, red teams, pen testers, etc., criminals.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.960
 And there's an old adage in locksmithing that says locks only keep honest people

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.600
 out, and this is pretty true.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.160
 If someone wants through your lock badly enough,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.920
 it's just a matter of resources and time.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.360
 They'll do it eventually if they want to,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.560
 it doesn't matter how good your lock is.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.840
 And I used to think that if you found problems with things and

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.880
 then reported it back to the people who made it, that they'd fix it.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.600
 And if this kept happening, security would generally get better in the world.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600
 And since I've been in the industry a while,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.240
 I've learned that that is not the case at all.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.320
 I don't think things are more secure now than they were when I first started

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.840
 locksmithing.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.080
 All right, so let's have a look at some physical attacks.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.440
 So hammers can be used in many different ways.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.840
 It might sound like a hammer, you just hit something, but

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.080
 it's like a wire shock or other tools.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.800
 You can use them for multiple purposes.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.360
 So this is an example of a lock that's been trounced with a hammer.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.600
 This is like the obvious thing that you do with a hammer.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.640
 Other things you can do include freezing the shackle so it becomes shatterable.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.920
 Or if the body of a padlock is made of aluminium or

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.440
 has any aluminium in it, you can actually put gallium on there and

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.680
 it'll react with the aluminium and make the aluminium all crumbly.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.040
 And then you could hit it with a hammer again and get into the lock that way.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.720
 Spanners are another interesting one.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.160
 So I don't know if many people have seen this before, but on the cheap locks,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.400
 you can use two spanners as demonstrated in the picture and just prize

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.360
 into the shackle and this is an attack on the lock body, the lock body will break.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.080
 But back to hammers.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.680
 Many padlocks for convenience, you can just shut them closed.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.920
 So the good ones have a ball bearing that locks the shackle in place, but

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.320
 the cheaper ones or the most padlocks, you just click and

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.040
 you shut the shackle like that.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.800
 And so we can make use of that spring and it's a conservation of momentum attack.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.960
 So like when one pool ball hits another pool ball, if we can create enough energy

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.840
 into the outside of the lock, then the idea is you can compress that spring and

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.160
 the shackle should just pop open.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.880
 And I can show you this in action.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:42.920
 So here's a couple of master padlocks.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.840
 I'm just demonstrating here that they are locked.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:56.120
 And that hits it with a hammer one, hits it with a hammer two, just pops open.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.880
 And you can do this on lots and lots of locks.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.960
 It's only a question really of how much energy you can get into the body of

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.480
 the padlock.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.280
 This is the story of the first vulnerability that I ever found in a lock.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.560
 So a long time ago, about 1998, when I were a lad, me and

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.840
 my friends used to go over Canik Chase in my mate's Jeep.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.880
 He had one of these Jeeps and he was obsessed with taking it

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.680
 into the places you shouldn't go.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.040
 Canik Chase, if you don't know, is like here.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.400
 It's just a wood with hills and forest.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.800
 And we couldn't get to the cool bits.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.440
 We couldn't get to the really cool bits because there's ditches and

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.520
 there's locked barriers.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.640
 And the lock on the barrier was this.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.280
 I actually found this in the street and I was driving past and

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.880
 I was like, shit, I know that lock.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.560
 I need to get that lock because that's the one that's on the barriers at Canik Chase.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.720
 So anyway, I got this lock and thought, well, this is the reasons they use it right.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.960
 It's weatherproof.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.120
 It has to be if it's in the forest.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.640
 And it's secure because it says so on the front of the lock there.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.600
 It must be.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.240
 So I didn't know how to pick lever locks at the time.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.760
 I sort of knew how they worked, but I didn't know how to pick them.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.400
 So I thought, let's break open the lock, see what I can find inside.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.000
 And at the time I didn't have a workshop or even a vice.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.240
 So I used a hammer again and a wood chisel.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.560
 It's not even a metal chisel, it's a wood chisel.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.880
 And I took it outside onto the pavements and

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.080
 just went at it until I broke it open.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.200
 And this is what it looks like today.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.960
 And when I got it open, I noticed that those little spike a bit circles

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.680
 are the bits that the key contacts.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.040
 And those little lumps on the left are the bits that need to be lifted so

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.480
 that the shackle can open.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.360
 Now this is an example of a good lever lock.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.120
 And a good lever lock has circle at the bottom there.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.440
 There's a physical barrier to stop you lifting the levers too high.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.880
 And that's not the case on this lock.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.640
 So I use like a two part attack, one part to tension the bolt thrower.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 And basically just a blank that goes up and pushes all four levers at once.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.040
 And you can see here at the side,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.600
 the levers have been lifted clear of the blocking part.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.720
 So the lock can open.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.840
 And the good thing is with this as well, you can lock it back up again.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.720
 And no one's ever known that you've been there.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.160
 And that led to a lot of fun over Can It Chase in the Jeep.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
 We almost died several times.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.680
 I'm surprised I'm still here to tell the tale.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.000
 This is another lock that I've spent a long time working on.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.920
 Abloy Classic, it's been around for a very long time.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.600
 1896, I think, Abloy invented this lock.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.480
 And it went unpicked for years.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.240
 And then in the 70s, a guy called Seppi E.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.400
 Turvinen, a Finnish sex pest, he used to pick the locks on,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.240
 pick this lock on women's doors, let himself in, and then he'd hide under the bed.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.400
 And then at some point in the night,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.840
 he'd come out and attack them like some sort of scary bogeyman.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.400
 And the Finnish police didn't think that he could actually pick the lock,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.000
 because this was the first example of this lock ever being picked in the field.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.440
 Before this, Abloy offered, yeah, a million fin marks reward if anyone could

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.840
 pick the lock, but obviously they scrapped that after this.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.760
 So what they did, Abloy changed the design of the lock.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.400
 The tool this guy was using, the Vempelay, it's Finnish thingamajig,

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.600
 or what do you call it, it's got some Finnish name.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.840
 And they changed the design, so this tool didn't work anymore.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.760
 And then this was about 1978, I think.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.200
 And since then, again, since the change to the design, allegedly,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.600
 it went unpicked.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.680
 And in a nutshell, here's the problem with trying to pick this lock.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.080
 You need 90 degrees of movement on your lock picking tool.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.960
 And you can see there's a gap there of 90 degrees, so you might think, okay,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.760
 you've got 90 degrees, you need 90 degrees movement.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.920
 What's the problem?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.560
 Well, the problem is, your lock picking tool has to exist within that 90 degrees as

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.520
 well, so if you go 90 degrees one way, you're going to upset the further most disk.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.920
 And if you put the tool on the other side and go 90 degrees the other way,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.120
 you're going to upset the other disk.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:37.680
 So, again, I took it apart and studied it for a long time and found out that you

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.440
 can actually get away with dislodging the disks a little bit.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.200
 And that's because, in the bottom picture, that little steel bit at the top,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.640
 that's the side bar, that's what prevents the lock from opening.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.480
 And it has to sit in that little U shape at the top of the disk.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.560
 And if you dislodge it, you can see it's not perfectly aligned, so if you dislodge

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.240
 it a little bit and you tension the lock, that side bar will push down into that U

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.080
 shape and end up pulling the disk back around, like by itself.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.920
 So you can get away with a little bit, so that led to me thinking, okay,

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.240
 so maybe I can do this.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.000
 Maybe we can exploit this.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.120
 And like I say, everyone in locksmithing said, this lock can't be picked.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.840
 It's not possible, no one's done it.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.280
 So it's like a red rag to a bottom, like, okay, I'm going to do this.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.720
 It doesn't matter how long it takes, I'm doing this.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.320
 So about six years of work, off and on, design after design, didn't work,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.880
 didn't work, and then I realized the design that I wanted to use was difficult

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.480
 to make, so I had to save up to buy a milling machine and make this very fine,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.720
 thin, delicate part.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.480
 Anyway, long story short, it worked.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.640
 I managed to make a tool that picked this lock.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.800
 And then three, four weeks later, a friend rings me up and says, oh,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.560
 your tool, that's really cool.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.680
 It's for sale on that locksmithing website.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.600
 I'm like, no, I don't know anything about this.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.280
 So I went to the website and I see pretty much the same design of my tool there.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.760
 So I contacted the website owner and he said, okay, so yeah,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.360
 the government's been using this tool for like eight years.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.360
 Only it's been restricted and it's not publicly available,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.880
 so no one knows about it.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.840
 And now you've done a design that's pretty much identical.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.760
 We can de-restrict it and sell it publicly now.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.880
 Oh, fuck.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.840
 Okay.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.040
 So I don't want to invent things that have already been done.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.160
 If I'd have known this tool existed already, I wouldn't have spent so much

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.200
 time and effort and money doing it.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.840
 So yeah, it was quite a kick in the balls.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.320
 But I decided, I'll tell you what, then, I'm going to use what I've learned and

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.280
 make the tool better.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.680
 And so this is the tool in action.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.160
 You don't get to see it.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.280
 The tool itself is restricted.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.440
 But this is the improved version of the tool that I made.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.560
 And it's a terrible video.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.640
 It was a while ago.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.080
 But anyway, the tool's in the lot now.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.760
 And I'm not really picking it.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.600
 It's a self-impressioning attack.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.640
 So I'm just jiggling the tool, basically.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.040
 And that's it.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.320
 13 seconds it took to open that lock with the improved tool.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.640
 And that's a lock that's meant to be unpickable.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.000
 This is another one of my favorite locks, Ever MCS.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.840
 It's a magnetic lock.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.360
 It was developed in Vienna, Austria.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.320
 And again, this lock went unpicked for a very long time, because you can't

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.880
 physically access the internals of it, because it's all magnetic.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.040
 And I've spent more time on this lock, I think, than any other lock.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.760
 So this is how it works.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.640
 You can see each of these wheels has got a little pie slice cut out of it.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.720
 And they all have to line up, like in the picture.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.640
 And there's a blocking element that will go into the pie slices and

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.680
 allow the lock to open.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.600
 And it's that times two on both sides of the lock.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.400
 And you can never know what position these little pie slices are in from

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.240
 outside the lock.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.240
 So ostensibly, it's impossible to open.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.600
 And then maybe 20 years ago, I got an email from a German friend.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.520
 And he said, in the MCS, those rotors, they're quite noisy.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.360
 I was thinking, you know what?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.720
 Yeah, they are quite noisy.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.040
 So I thought, well, maybe we can leverage the noise thing, see if we

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.240
 can open the lock.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.400
 So using a guitar pickup--

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.960
 you don't have to use a guitar pickup, by the way.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.320
 You can hear it, but this aids it to a massive degree.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:42.040
 So using a guitar pickup, you can tell which wheel is incorrect.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.640
 So you can't tell which one's right, but you can tell when it's wrong.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.680
 So if something's wrong, then you change it.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.880
 And it's still wrong, and you change it.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.040
 And all of a sudden, it's right.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.960
 And another one's wrong.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.840
 You repeat this process until everything's right.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.160
 And then the lock opens.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.400
 So you've got 2.2 millimeters of space to work with in this lock.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.920
 So making something that simulated the key was very difficult.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.800
 These is four failed designs.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.000
 The one in the top left is just magnets superglued to a bit of metal.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.160
 That didn't work.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.880
 The other one's like fiddly little magnets you push into holes.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.680
 I mean, it sort of worked, but it was fiddly.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.400
 And yeah, anyway, none of these worked.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.200
 But eventually, I managed to simulate how the original key worked.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.400
 Now, you can't copy how ever have made their keys.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.440
 They've magnetized the magnets in--

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.920
 they've patented the process they used to magnetize the magnets.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.920
 But using two magnets on each side, you can simulate the key,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.960
 which is exactly what I've done here.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.360
 But this only was the start.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.640
 You then had to--

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.080
 I then had to work on the technique to narrow it down.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.320
 But eventually, I got to the point where I can open the MCS lock as well.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.320
 I don't know if anyone knows this lock.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.480
 Again, another unpickable lock.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.560
 Boli, they've not been around long.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.200
 Bless them.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.320
 They have tried their hardest to make a lock that's unpickable.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.880
 And I guess it's a good idea on the face of it.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.200
 This is the key for the Boli.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.360
 And you can see you've got this funny U shape in it.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.000
 And that bit missing in the middle, that goes around like a metal shield.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.840
 So that if you want to try and pick this lock,

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.400
 your lock picks have to go around that U shape

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.440
 and also manipulate the five pins.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.480
 And because there's only maybe two millimeters of gap at the end,

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.880
 you physically don't have the space to pick the lock.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.680
 So if traditional lock picks won't work, then that's a win, right?

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.520
 They've made an unpickable lock.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.960
 Oh, no, not at all.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.760
 I've got a video of me opening this lock.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:54.200
 That one?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.700
 Yeah.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:19:02.720
 So we'll skip forward a little.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.120
 So what I'm using here is--

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.720
 again, it's another conservation of momentum attack.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.080
 So I don't know if you know how key bumping works.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.640
 But basically, what you do, you hit all of the bottom pins simultaneously.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.480
 And the top pins then absorb the energy and fly up away from the bottom pins,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.560
 creating a big gap between the two.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.480
 And if you time it right, you can open the lock while that gap exists.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.800
 And that's what I'm doing here only.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.680
 This is an EPG.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.200
 It's an electric pick gun.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.040
 So it does that, but just really fast.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.080
 It's not a drill.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.400
 People sometimes think it's a drill, it's not a drill.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.840
 So that's vibrating the pins now.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:44.100
 And that's it.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.440
 The lock's open at this point.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.920
 So this unpickable lock--

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.160
 I used to say I can open this lock with a paper clip.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.360
 And people used to laugh at me.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.520
 And well, actually, it's perfectly possible that that's the back spinning

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.440
 just to prove it's open.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.600
 And yeah, like you see, it's very effective and very fast.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.120
 This is another one of my pet locks, if you like.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.160
 I went through the chain of Abloy locks.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.800
 And this is like their current top of the range lock, Abloy ProTech 2.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.760
 It is now.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.840
 It uses a disk blocking system.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.480
 So the idea here is that if the disks are jammed in place,

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.560
 then if you try and manipulate them, you can't,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.160
 because they're physically unmovable.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.440
 What I did was I looked at the differences between ProTech 1

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.600
 and ProTech 2 and had a look at what they changed

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.440
 between the two versions, which gave me a lot of hints

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.000
 as to what the problems with the ProTech 1 might have been,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.160
 because otherwise they wouldn't have changed things, right?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.200
 And actually, the ProTech 2, some of the new changes they made

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.920
 introduced new problems.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.520
 And this happens again with digital security all the time.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.720
 So I broke it down into stages how I can open this lock.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.840
 They're like chain invulnerabilities.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.080
 So originally, I bypassed the DBS, that's the disk blocking system,

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.720
 with a piece of wire, which can be seen here.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.880
 And since then, I've found quite a few ways to do it.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.160
 But originally, I did it like this.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.360
 So the two bars on either side of the lock

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.240
 have to meet and come together and sort of slip down

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.720
 one under the other.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.160
 And that piece of wire allows them to meet,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.600
 but it doesn't allow them to physically slip down

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.560
 into the grooves and block the disks.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.600
 So that was the first stage, bypass the disk blocking system.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.080
 Even then, you still have to manipulate the lock, which

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.360
 is very difficult in itself.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.680
 But at least now, the blocking system is neutralized.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.240
 At least it's possible.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.480
 My current ProTech 2 tools are restricted,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.600
 so I can't show those.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.080
 But we can open the ProTech 2 as well.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.280
 It's in a folder.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.960
 It's in the folder full of NDAs.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.120
 I've got loads of NDAs from different lock companies

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.600
 and tool makers and that sort of things.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.720
 This one's kind of fun.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.760
 Kensington laptop lock.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.000
 This is used to secure digital IT infrastructure.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.760
 And I thought, again, it's got a sprung shackle on the bottom

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.160
 so you can just push the wire in for convenience.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.640
 And it's locked.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.880
 And I thought, so I'm going to try the same thing on this lock.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.480
 I'm going to try and bounce those springs back.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.480
 So I got a hammer again.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.480
 And I was only tapping it-- I swear to God,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.240
 I was only tapping it gently.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.280
 And it just fell off.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.760
 And I was like, whoa, surely that isn't right.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.400
 And what's happened with this is when you hit it,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.480
 there's a part inside that deforms.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480
 And it allows the shutters to still work.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.440
 So you can still come back and put the lock on.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.320
 And you can still use the key.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.360
 And the user would never know there was a problem with it.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.600
 But yeah, it's very, very, very shit.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.360
 And it was accidental, like I say.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.280
 A lot of best discoveries are the accidental ones, right?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.320
 I wasn't even trying to do this to this lock.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.440
 Let's have a look at some digital stuff now.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.640
 So I don't know if anyone's got ring doorbells.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.760
 I mean, I know I've got one.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.720
 And they're pretty useless, right?

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.040
 I think the Sol's like a security device.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.440
 But I mean, they're not.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.520
 They're not right.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.880
 So the problem with these is in order

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.280
 to see who's at your front door, it has to make essentially

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.840
 a VoIP call.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.000
 There's no local recording on the device.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.640
 So if comms drops, then you don't

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.080
 know there's anyone at your door.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.240
 And worse, when the comms comes back off,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.720
 if someone has been at your door, again, you don't know.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.480
 It doesn't give you any sort of indication

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.640
 that there's been someone there.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.320
 I believe the Ring Alarm Pro actually

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.520
 has a little SD card that records locally on it.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.960
 So that's better.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.200
 That is better.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.720
 So how could we attack this?

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.640
 Well, if you cut the power to the place,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.480
 then comms are going to go down.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.680
 I mean, that's pretty noisy.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.960
 It doesn't have to be destructive if you've

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.120
 got access to the breaker.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.960
 But again, the phone line, if you've got the phone line,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.120
 comms are going to be down.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.600
 And like if you've got access to the signal box, again,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.840
 it's not necessarily destructive.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.000
 You can jam the wireless, which again, is a bit better, I guess.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.440
 But you risk jamming other stuff.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.960
 But what you can do is using Wireshark is sniff the MAC

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.960
 address and just de-auth it off the network.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.920
 And if you just keep de-authing it off the network,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.640
 then the owner of the Ring doorbell

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.960
 never knows-- doesn't know anything's happening.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.840
 And yeah, that's very targeted, very clean.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.320
 That's probably the best way to do it, I think.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.880
 And yeah, like I say, when it connects back to the network,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.080
 it's as if nothing's happened.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.920
 The user would never know you'd been there.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.000
 There's a trade-off between convenience and security,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.600
 always.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.200
 And this is one of those.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.680
 So people are getting wireless alarms

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.920
 fitted a lot because it's more convenient than drilling holes

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.640
 and laying cables.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.120
 And they've got exactly the same problems as the Ring doorbell.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.560
 So again, any sort of connectivity loss,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.240
 and it's a problem.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.920
 So you can sniff the MAC address of a particular wireless sensor.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.160
 And again, you can de-auth them off the network.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.200
 You can jam them.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.800
 One of the cool things you can do is if you know the protocol,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.040
 you can talk to the base station and make out

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.040
 that the signal isn't an alarm, when really it is.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.480
 The better alarm systems won't let you get away with this

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.800
 because they will pull back regularly to either

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.840
 from the sensor to the base station

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.360
 or from the base station to whoever

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.160
 might be supervising the alarm.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.800
 But how long do you actually need to get--

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.240
 if you've opened a door already, then maybe you only

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.040
 need three or four seconds, five seconds maybe,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.680
 to open and shut that door again.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.640
 And physical access is always king.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.720
 If you can get to a system physically, then you own it.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.160
 So I much preferred wired alarm systems.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.440
 Often you have redundant comms.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.400
 So you've got the phone line, and then there'll

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.320
 be a 5G connection as well.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.560
 And again, if you were to jam the 5G

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.920
 and put the phone line, the better systems

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.040
 will pull back to whoever's supervising the alarm

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.160
 and say, yeah, it's gone offline.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.720
 Put it into alarm.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.640
 And again, attack vectors for this.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.000
 So you can target individual sensors for wired alarm systems.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.360
 If you can get physical access to something,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.040
 you've got it, right?

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.120
 Another thing you could do is protocol reversal.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.520
 Again, so if you've got physical access to some of the wires--

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.840
 I know someone who's done this, in fact--

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.880
 if you can get an access point into the network,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.200
 then you can spoof whatever you want to the base station.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.080
 And a lot of sensors have got blind spots as well.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.400
 Badly installed alarm systems are everywhere.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.240
 And you can socially engineer your way in.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.360
 There's lots of ways.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.200
 These read sensors are on the doors of alarm systems.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.280
 I'm sure you've seen these everywhere.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.400
 Now there's a few ways you can get to these.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.360
 Normally, it's normally closed with a magnet that keeps it

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.400
 from going into alarm.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.840
 So let's say you're on the outside of a door

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.960
 and you don't know the position of an alarm sensor.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.040
 You can sense for that magnet using a hall sensor.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.920
 And that'll tell you where the switch is,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.960
 where the sensor is.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.400
 And so if you then know where it is,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.480
 you can then simulate that magnet on the outside of the door,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.920
 so long as the magnet's sufficiently powerful enough,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.800
 or even better, if there's a gap in the door--

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.760
 and I've done this-- if there's a gap in the door,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.480
 you can feed a little magnet through and simulate

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.760
 the magnet on the door.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.360
 And then obviously, you keep the magnet there and open the door

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.960
 and the sensor doesn't know anything's happened.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.200
 If you've got physical access, then you

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.280
 can permanently trick it using a little round magnet.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.800
 You can tape a magnet to the sensor.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.800
 And because you're doing that when the alarm isn't activated,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.840
 when it is activated, that magnet's permanently there then.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.560
 So again, you can open and close the door,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.040
 and that magnet is tricking the sensor into thinking nothing's

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.840
 happened.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.760
 These are fun, too.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.240
 Dual passive infrared and microwave.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.040
 So in order to get these to go into alarm,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.800
 both parts have to be tripped, both the microwave

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.160
 and the infrared.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.560
 And there's three lights on there.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.600
 There's a green, an amber, and a red.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.520
 And green means not a problem.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.000
 Amber means one of the two has been tripped.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.960
 And if it goes red, then both of the two have been tripped.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.680
 And then it goes into alarm.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.440
 I don't know if there's anyone else done this.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.880
 This might be weird, but sometimes I go into shops

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.280
 and you'll see these sensors.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.040
 And obviously, the alarms aren't activated,

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.840
 but the sensor's still active.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.360
 And so you can walk around the room

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.040
 and see how sensitive the alarm is

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.680
 and where the blind spots are.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.520
 So if you walk to the edge of the room,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.040
 and all of a sudden it stops going orange or red,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.840
 so there's the line of-- that's where

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.640
 the sensor can see to.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.800
 And I do that quite a lot.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:18.600
 The infrared part is the easiest part to trick on these,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.240
 because it just sees heat.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.480
 It sees changes in heat.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.320
 So if you can get some sort of room temperature shields--

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.400
 if you were to enter a room that has one of these

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.000
 and you have a shield in front of you

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.280
 that is the same temperature as everything else,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.640
 then the alarm's not going to see.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.640
 And it can be something as simple as just cardboard,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.040
 something really simple.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.800
 If you can get physical access to it while it's not alarmed,

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.720
 then again, physical access is king.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.760
 They did this in the Antwerp diamond heist.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.200
 They spread-- there's a whole talk

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.560
 about the Antwerp diamond heist.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.760
 It was absolutely brilliant.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.520
 But they had-- they'd rented out safety deposit

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.680
 boxes in the vault.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.140
 And so when they were in the vault,

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.360
 ostensibly going about the regular work,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.940
 they sprayed hairspray or latex onto the sensor

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.440
 while it wasn't in alarm.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.680
 And then later on when they came back,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.080
 the alarm was blinded-- the sensor was blinded,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.920
 because they'd already sprayed it and it couldn't see them there.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.720
 Another trick I've heard people say you can do

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.480
 is turn the heating up to body temperature.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.800
 So if you walk in, it doesn't see your body temperature.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.320
 But I don't know how feasible that is.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.960
 And if all else fails, you can trick them

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.280
 by walking really slowly.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.880
 But if you're in a situation that sort of isn't

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.800
 conducive to that, it's probably a bad idea.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.240
 Bad installation of alarm systems, again,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.080
 is really common.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.280
 They'll miss places.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.080
 They'll-- the CCTV, the sensors will have blind spots.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.280
 A lot of the old cameras, you can blind them

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.960
 with lasers or infrared.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.280
 And if there's a wire exposed from the outside,

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.560
 like in this picture, then again, if you

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.160
 can get into the network, then you can inject protocols into it.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.840
 There's a really cool talk-- hold on, I've written it down.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.240
 Yeah, exploiting network surveillance,

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240
 like a Hollywood hacker.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.820
 It's a DEF CON talk from a while ago.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.000
 And they did exactly that.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.280
 They reverse engineered the protocol.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.880
 And in the end, they could inject whatever they wanted

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.920
 into the CCTV feed, like text, video, whatever.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.840
 They totally own the CCTV.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.040
 Babak Javadi and Keith Hale have done some good stuff

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.280
 on this as well, if you want to look those guys up.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.840
 Something else you can do is deliberately trip an alarm

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.800
 over and over again.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.240
 So you can see what the response time is

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.760
 and the response strength is.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.280
 And often, if you keep doing it over and over again,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.200
 whoever is in charge of the alarm system

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.440
 is just going to get annoyed and take

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.560
 the sensor out of the system.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.080
 And that's the idea sometimes.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.080
 Or you can do what I said with the read sensor earlier,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.280
 but deliberately get the magnet wrong

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.480
 and trip the alarm from the outside of the door

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.480
 and do the same sort of thing.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.680
 Same with vibration sensors and floors or fences.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.040
 And yeah, like I say, you can use it to sort of socially

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.360
 engineer the response.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.160
 Access control-- a lot of these are

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.080
 vulnerable to a magnetic attack.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.200
 So they've got relays in them.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.440
 And often as well, these are on the outside of buildings,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.840
 but they'll put really bad screws in them,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.160
 like security screws.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.000
 But if you have the right screwdriver,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.600
 you can just get into there.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 And again, if you've got physical access to it,

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.520
 then you can use it to sniff creds.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.320
 You can jump the contacts inside of the box to open it.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.880
 And again, you can do protocol injection with this stuff too.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.440
 Smart locks are quite an interesting one.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.120
 These are getting popular now.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.660
 The problem with these is a lot of them

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.160
 were designed by electronics engineers,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.680
 not people who are well versed in physical security.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.760
 So even if the digital side of it is secure,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.960
 then you can still manipulate or bypass the locks.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.320
 A lot of these can be bypassed using a hammer drill.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.200
 Not a hammer drill.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.640
 Hammer drill, is it?

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.480
 Reciprocating drill.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.400
 And you can bump the solenoid in the middle.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.720
 And lots of manufacturers copy the design of each other.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.600
 And so these vulnerabilities are present in all of them.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:45.320
 So yeah, like I say, you can open them often from--

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.620
 there's a solenoid in the middle.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.640
 So when you come along with your card or your phone

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.640
 or whatever and open it, and it authenticates,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.040
 this little solenoid moves back.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.160
 But it's often on a spring.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.240
 And we can do the same thing I was talking about earlier

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.960
 with a spring, and we can hit the outside of the lock,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.120
 compress that spring from the outside, and then open the lock.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.640
 And the thing about this is there's normally

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.000
 an audit trial, selling you who's been

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.120
 and when they've been there.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.840
 But this totally bypasses any sort of audit trial.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.360
 And yeah, you put a 3D printed head adapter on it

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.720
 and use a hammer drill.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.520
 And that's just the physical side of it.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.440
 I mean, there are a lot of really bad smart locks

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.080
 where there are keys in clear text

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.280
 going over the Wi-Fi and predictable rolling codes,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280
 replay attacks.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.240
 I mean, they've been littered with problems

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.520
 since their invention.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.600
 Routers, so I mean, routers are pretty bad anyway, right?

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.720
 For a long time, you've been able to get onto them

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.520
 using default admin.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.480
 I mean, WEP, WEP was useless.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.440
 There was brute force in the pin.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.920
 I mean, that's better now.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.800
 But again, that was something that was pretty easy to do.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.840
 There was an old virgin box where you'd started up,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.360
 and the Wi-Fi would come up open.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.160
 And then it would go back down again and come back up,

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.560
 WPA2.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.840
 But if you could get onto it while it was open,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.640
 then again, you could use the default creds and own the box.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.200
 I spoke about this briefly earlier.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.040
 Virgin, DOCSIS 1.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.280
 I mean, we're going back a while.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.200
 But yeah, you could sniff the MAC addresses

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.680
 and swap them with each other and end up

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.240
 getting free virgin internet.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.440
 And this is a common one.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.040
 Default wireless passwords derived from the MAC address.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.000
 British Telecom made this mistake.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.960
 And loads and loads of their routers,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.880
 you could derive the password.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.760
 All right, so briefly, let's have a look at some methodologies.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.480
 So this guy, Daniel Heiss, he was convicted in Australia

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.040
 for murdering a guy.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.960
 Him and his friends wanted his guns.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.760
 And so he got sent to Barrymore Prison.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.280
 And when he got there, he found a fellow inmate

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.720
 who'd got sort of privileged status.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.240
 And he was a jeweler on the outside.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.840
 So he'd been given access to jewelry making equipment.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.680
 And he said, OK, they got together and said,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.360
 let's make a key.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.360
 Let's make a key and we can get out.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.240
 And they could have tried to view the key

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.840
 as the wardens were using it.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.960
 But where they actually got the key from

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.720
 is much better than that.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.680
 So when you first go to Barrymore Prison,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.720
 they gave you like a booklet saying,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.880
 welcome to the prison.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.800
 This is what you should do.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.080
 This is what you shouldn't do.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080
 And on the front cover of the brochure

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.320
 were the master keys to the prison.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.040
 And so he just copied those and they escaped.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.680
 He left a cheesy message saying, this bird has flown on his cell.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.800
 Baker, the jeweler, 24 hours he got recaptured and Heiss,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.400
 12 days.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.760
 And then he got out and started making terrible art.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.920
 And now he's back in prison again for parole violation.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.400
 But the point of this story is observation.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.760
 If you look hard enough, you can see some pretty cool stuff.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.680
 So photos of keys.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.520
 There's now a machine.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.920
 This is an easy entry machine.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.360
 It'll copy like the profile of a key, any key.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.680
 Well, nearly any key.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.200
 But there's actually systems now that

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.440
 will take long range photographs of a key

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.800
 and automatically decode the bidding

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.120
 and then automatically cut the key.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.040
 So observation can be really useful.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.240
 Don't put photos online either.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.120
 This mistake happens quite a lot, like here.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:47.120
 So SS Dev, the guys who were doing the lock picking village.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.600
 The Dutch police had these new high security handcuffs.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.200
 And the lock on them was good.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.520
 It wasn't like generic handcuffs where one key will

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.760
 open pretty much all of them.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.400
 These were good handcuffs.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.120
 It was a chub three lever lock.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.400
 Anyway, they put images of it online.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.640
 And so the guys at SS Dev saw it, copied the key.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.480
 And this 3D printed key will now open these high security

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.320
 Dutch handcuffs.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.240
 This is something else I've done quite a lot, sports events.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.360
 If you watch TV at sports events,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.080
 you can get a lot of useful information.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.760
 So these are all passes that I've

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.400
 managed to grab off TV and Twitter feeds

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.880
 and that sort of thing.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.320
 And once you see them, they're really easy to copy.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.800
 You can get in.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.640
 This is one on a dog.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.000
 I don't know if the dog actually had a legitimate pass.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.440
 But this is a legitimate format of pass.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.160
 So yeah, just copy this.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.320
 And I did this at the World Cup in 2006, actually in Germany.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.680
 Premier League, cricket, music festivals.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.760
 Copying passes is a really, really easy way

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.280
 to get into places.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.600
 Another way we can try and find out some vulnerabilities

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.200
 in stuff is look at what's been changed in the new version

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.480
 to the old version.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.200
 So revision notes do this a lot.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.480
 In software, they'll say, yeah, we fixed this and this.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:10.960
 And they go, OK.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.000
 So if you look at it, you know that, oh, that

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.840
 used to be a problem.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.880
 And that used to be a problem.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.560
 And so if you ever find an older version of that software,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.040
 you know for a fact that it's got X, Y, and Z wrong with it.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.920
 And like I say, this applies to physical and digital security.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.360
 I did it with the ProTech.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.840
 And if ever they change something,

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.040
 look at what they've changed.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:39.960
 So probably the best way to go about finding vulnerabilities

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.000
 in stuff is like what I did earlier,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.600
 methodically break down the system,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.880
 look at every part of it, see if you can find a hole,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.880
 and exploit the hole.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.200
 And like I say, you get common designs from one manufacturer

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.800
 to another, decapping PSUs and electromagnetic microscope

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.080
 scanning so you can see exactly what's going on in stuff.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.400
 And fuzzing is another one.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.080
 So just throwing stuff at it.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.600
 And if something sticks, you don't really

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.720
 need to know how it works.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.600
 If it works, it works.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.920
 And accidental discoveries.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.880
 A lot of fun there.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.960
 Some of my best discoveries have been accidental discoveries.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.040
 And then try and look at ways in which a system can

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.480
 leak information.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.720
 So like cryptographic wait times,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.720
 I use the sound I mentioned earlier.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.560
 You can measure the rotation of a lock or the arm on a safe

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.320
 to know how close you are to open it.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.880
 There's lots of ways systems can leak information

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.880
 that whoever designed them didn't intend them to.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.720
 And be inventive.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.360
 Look for unconventional attack vectors.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.200
 And I'm a big fan of this last one.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.360
 As soon as you've found a way to do something,

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.880
 try and find another way to do it.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.640
 And then try and find another way to do it.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.680
 There's many solutions to the same problem as you can.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.400
 So you've got some sort of redundancy.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.200
 And the concepts between digital security

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.440
 and physical security, they're the same.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:06.320
 But once you've found a problem, you have to ask yourself,

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.000
 is it practical?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.640
 Just because something's feasible

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.040
 doesn't mean it's practical.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.120
 So physical keys, I could have like 10,000 keys to a lock.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.960
 And I mean, it's feasible for me to try every key.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.560
 And one of them will eventually open.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.000
 But it's not practical.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.480
 And it's like brute forcing passwords.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.560
 If a password is sufficiently strong enough,

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.040
 then it might take 10,000 years.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.920
 And yet, it's feasible.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.880
 But it's not practical.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.320
 So you have to ask yourself, just

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.880
 because you've found a problem, can I actually exploit it?

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.360
 And don't forget that every security system,

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.240
 ever invented, was designed by people.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.920
 People no smarter than you or me.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.640
 And people always miss stuff.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.760
 So remember, nothing's ever perfect.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.440
 If you have to get a more complex system,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.160
 often that leaves a larger attack surface.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.400
 So you can find more problems if something's

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.520
 been made more complicated.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.940
 And like I said, they're just people.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.920
 People miss things.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.480
 And they can't see the future.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.040
 They can't see what's going to happen.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.000
 Like so safes in the past were very secure.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.920
 They were very burglar-proof.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.200
 And then x-rays came along.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.960
 And they didn't know what x-rays were

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.440
 when they invented the safe.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.880
 And all of a sudden, you could get into the safe.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.600
 And the good safes nowadays actually

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.880
 have x-ray protection on them.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.080
 So you can't do that.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.440
 And yeah, another one, never give up until you've done it,

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.400
 until you've broken it.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.600
 Keep going.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.880
 So yeah, I've only scratched the surface of the subject.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.200
 I could do this talk again and replace everything

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.880
 I've just said with other examples.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.320
 There's so much to go into.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.880
 Other people's stuff, historical biggies.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.680
 And yeah, a lot of the stuff that I can't disclose as well.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.160
 And I think the bottom line here is if I can do it,

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.560
 anyone can do it.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.880
 Just go and find some cool shit and break it.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.400
 That's it.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.880
 We're done.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.360
 [APPLAUSE]

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:12.120
 So yeah, thanks a lot for the talk, Matt.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.880
 We are going to have like three minutes for questions.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:21.760
 So if you can line up here for questions, it would be great.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.280
 I don't think that's working.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.000
 Is this working?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.760
 Maybe it is.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.280
 Maybe it is.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:26.780
 Perfect.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.640
 Any questions?

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.200
 I can't see.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:39.800
 Do we have a Q&A mic there?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.300
 OK.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.200
 So let's give a last big huge applause to Matt.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:46.700
 Thanks.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.040
 [APPLAUSE]

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.580
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.160
 (gentle music)
