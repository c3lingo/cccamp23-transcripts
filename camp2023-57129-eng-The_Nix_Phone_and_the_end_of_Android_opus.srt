3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:33,680
 How many people know what Nix is?

4
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,000
 NixOS is a very basic language.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,240
 Well, Nix is a language and NixOS makes use of it.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,520
 And all you do is describe your computer in basic ways.

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,760
 Like I want Firefox installed, or

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,680
 I want this behavior when the system boots up.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,560
 And then it just goes ahead and does it.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,240
 And you can apply that, it turns out, to mobile devices.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,440
 So what is mobile NixOS?

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,080
 You can find out about it at mobile.nixos.org.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,080
 And the author of this is Samuel Dior.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,800
 I didn't make it, I just use it.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,400
 So this is what it looks like.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,720
 I was gonna try and show you it here, but

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,960
 I guess that's not gonna work out because it's too small of a

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,240
 screen and it's too bright.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,720
 But you can hook it up to the monitor.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,240
 You can put a USB hub into it.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,800
 And you can have fun using your normal computer because

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,160
 phones are never going to be the same again,

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,320
 when people realize this.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,760
 So you can use it like this, or you can use it like this.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,840
 And this is the amount of code that I need to write, and

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,760
 I appreciate that it's not a good environment to show it often.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,200
 But it's a very small diff.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
 It looks like one, two, three, four, it looks like ten lines of code.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,560
 I can make a NixOS configuration that already exists work on

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
 my phone instead of on my laptop.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,720
 Now the work that made the kernel, the Linux kernel,

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,680
 work on this device has been done by Caleb Connolly.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,240
 And they may be at this camp, I don't know if they're here, but

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,320
 they've done amazing work over the past two years, all spare time.

35
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 And a lot of work is inherited from post market OS.

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,960
 I'm using a window manager called SXMO, which makes use of Sway,

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,200
 which is a tiling window manager.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
 And it turns it into a sort of mobile operating system.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,840
 By the way, you can also run Windows 10 on the phone if you

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,960
 want via this UEFI implementation.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,800
 And by the way, we can run Android as well.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,960
 So if you want to just escape to Android for a second, you can.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,720
 You click one button and you've got Weidroid.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,680
 And then you swipe to the left and you're back in full Linux.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,720
 And how do we do that?

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 It's that single line of code right there.

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,280
 So if anyone is skeptical of Nix and NixOS, you should check it out.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
 And by the way, we can emulate x86 programs.

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
 So if we just run like Bitwig Studio or

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,360
 some program that runs under Windows, under Wine,

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,160
 it will just run on the device, just with this one line of code.

52
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,320
 And you can do local speech processing on the device.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
 It doesn't take much time.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
 Potential future, well, maybe we'll get USB-C and

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,400
 display ports everywhere.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
 The demo I showed you of making it work on a monitor,

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
 that's just a hack because it works over USB.

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,120
 This doesn't have display port mode out of the USB socket.

59
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,240
 And by the way, everything's kind of insecure because there's no

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,160
 secure boot implementation, but in the future that could change.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,360
 There's nothing stopping us from implementing secure boots on

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,200
 this device because it has a trusted platform module, etc.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,760
 Phones that are worth using are rare.

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,760
 This is one in a million because this is a OnePlus 6.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,840
 It's got 10 gigs of RAM.

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,320
 It cost $100.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,040
 Maybe you should all go buy one, but then the price won't be $100

68
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,600
 anymore.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,680
 Yeah, and this is kind of like the only phone that works this

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,320
 well at this time.

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,720
 Your phone is a computer.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,160
 If we can get USB-C on every device, maybe we can get an open

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,920
 bootloader on every device as well.

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
 And the European Commission reckons that the USB-C

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
 connector saves a lot of money.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
 How much money could this save?

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
 Because this isn't just a connector.

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,600
 This allows you to run any piece of software you want on your

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 mobile device, and everyone's phone is probably enough

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,880
 computation for them.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
 And that's it.

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
 That's my talk.

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,400
 Oh, actually, Stardust XR, it's a VR display thing.

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,680
 It allows you to pick windows up with your fingers and stuff

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,080
 like this.

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,320
 You could use it with these glasses.

87
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,000
 I've been using the phone with these glasses.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
 If you think the display is too small, don't, because you can

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
 just put it on these glasses, and you can have a big monitor

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
 or a world of monitors around you.

91
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,400
 And many other disaster setups have been made by me that I

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,800
 can't show off because I don't have any time.

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
 Oh, yeah, the head computer.

94
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,960
 [APPLAUSE]

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,960
 Thank you.

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,720
 Cool.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
 Oh, one last thing.

98
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,200
 If you want to see more about this, come to the Nixos tent

99
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
 next to Seabase, and you can hang out with me.

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,680
 And I'll be doing a talk about this tomorrow, if you're

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,120
 interested.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,360
 Thank you very much.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,680
 [APPLAUSE]

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,760
