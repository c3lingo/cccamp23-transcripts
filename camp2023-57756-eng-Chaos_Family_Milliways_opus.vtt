00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Chaos Family.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 This time...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Now let me start over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 What we want to do with this show is present you or get you interested in all the people and groups and operating centers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 and all the interesting people on the campgrounds that do stuff to show you how diverse and how big and how interesting the event is and the people running around here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 With me on the couch we have three members of Milleways, one of the largest groups at the camp.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Let's start with Zornem, then we have Klaun and Emerson.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Thanks for joining.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 We'll do the casting.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 I'm not sure... yeah, okay, whatever.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I have to emphasize all three of them are here voluntarily. We did not force them to join us here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It's a lie.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 So let's start with you.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 The decide between the three of us who's going to take the question.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Could you describe me what Milleways is?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 I love the way everyone points at me.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 This feels profoundly unfair.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So Milleways is a running joke that became a thing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 So, okay, to understand this you have to go back a ways.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 First there was the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which started out as a British radio play,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 then became a novel, big global hit, absurd, existentialist comedy, science fiction comedy.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And right from the very earliest days of the camps and right from the earliest days of the CCC,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 this ancient, absurd, English language, profoundly British science fiction comedy

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 has had a real influence throughout the whole history really of the CCC.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Because they all date from about the same era, which is the late 70s.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 And Milleways is the restaurant at the end of the universe from first the radio play and then the book

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and then the TV series and then the movie and so on and so forth.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 All of which, by the way, are great. They really haven't aged at all.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 So totally recommend go away, read those, watch those.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And so what happened was that over the years the Hockey community obviously is very international.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It spans most of the continents of the world.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 In fact, actually we even went to Antarctica together with the tour camp folks.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And what ended up happening was that there was kind of like a coming together of a bunch of folks from the US

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 who came over to one of the first camps in the early 2000s.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And basically their organization was a complete disaster, like a, you know, like dreadful.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And they found themselves kind of like weirdly stranded and really in need of like a friendly face.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And that's really how it all got going. We were literally like all thrown together.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I ended up cooking for the very first iteration of Milleways, literally because the Americans had brought nothing.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 And it was just like, okay, right, well, clearly we need to feed you guys.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 We're all just going to go to MÃ©tro and just go and do a massive run.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And out of this sort of like bubbling chaos, this idea of like, well, actually, you know what?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 We really enjoy each other's company.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And so what's happened over the years is that the Europeans have spent, go every year to the States,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 usually for DEFCON or tour camp, tour con, or any one of the other sort of crazy adventures, including the Antarctic one.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And then the Americans who run events in the States come here.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And Milleways is kind of this sort of like weird agglomerate, running joke that came in an agglomeration

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 that's now sort of metamorphosed into a big thing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Because most of us actually are experienced conference organizers, experienced event organizers,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 or like come from different backgrounds, which basically means that, you know,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 we can kind of come around the things that actually really kind of like unite us as a group of people,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 which is a love of eating, drinking and like absurdist jokes and technology.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 It's kind of like all sort of together.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 It was very kind of you to avoid saying drugs.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Yes. Yeah. Shut up. We don't say that. Yeah. This is like a, this is a family show.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Like ethanol in beer.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Shush. Shush. Quiet.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 What about the Scottish embassy and their wine thing?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 OK. So the story with all of those guys is that, so as the years have gone on and Milleways has actually moved between events.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 So we did, obviously we've been doing the camps, we've been doing the Dutch events, we've been doing the US events.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 But then we've also done things like EMF in the UK.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Electromagnetic field. Yeah. Electromagnetic field.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And we're very good friends with all of the organizers of these events.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And so of course now when there's a European, you know, when there's an event in Germany or an event in the Netherlands and the like,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 it's like it's a natural place to come because, you know, multilingual first language is English very often.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And it always attracts a good mixture of people from a lot.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 So nobody actually feels, excuse me, even if we're all like from, you know, we have a Latvian contingent, you know, which is like, it's tiny.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 You know, it's like, oh, you're so small. You want to pet them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 But it's probably deeply patronizing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 But what that means is that all of these folks can come and really sort of like just come and hang out.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And it's very, very easy.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 On top of that, over the years, Milliways has also attracted a number of people who are in the tech and security community, really quite famous.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 You know, like we always used to have Dank Minsky come stay with us.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 We always used to have, you know, he's sadly departed now.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 But, you know, there are all these other sort of like, you know, folks who are relatively speaking fairly famous and the like.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And, you know, you could always just come and camp with us.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And it was always just an open door. It still is an open door.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Show up. You know.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 So to give you a breather, maybe one of you two want to pick up on that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 How do I get into Milliways?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 I mean, can it be an organization like EMF Camp or the Scottish Embassy to join Milliways?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Do I have to sign up forms?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 If I'm attending, for example, EMF Camp in the UK as a European, sorry.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Can I just show up and say, Hi, Milliways, I'm here?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 How does this work?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Can I as an individual join Milliways at an event?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 I mean, that's more or less how I ended up here.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 So the entire story about how I ended up here involves a big back story.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 But in a way, Milliways actually ended up in me moving to Germany where I've been living for now more than 10 years.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 I showed up to the first camp and I had no idea what to expect.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 I had no idea what I was doing or why even I was here.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And then one of the first things you do when you get to camp is where am I going to pitch my tent?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Like, who am I going to hang out with?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 I don't know anyone here.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And somebody whispered in my ear, Hey, go over to the Milliways Village.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 They are friendly people.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Sometimes they cook food.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 They always cook food and they're always friendly.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And for sure you will have a good time.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And whoever whispered in my ear, thank you from the future. You are absolutely 100% correct.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And it's nice, especially during this event, I've heard that some people have been walking around camp showing people around.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 That's more or less the description of Milliways that I overhear.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Ah, yeah, there's the Milliways. They're generally nice people, very friendly.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 You can hang out there and they cook food.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So the topic of food came up quite often now.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Apparently, are the British still in charge of the kitchen?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 No, no, I abdicated those responsibilities ages ago.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So, no, this year I have organized the kitchen and I came to Milliways similarly to you.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 I wanted to go to Maycontain Hackers last year and I didn't want to do some tiny sub-village with friends.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 I didn't know whom of my friends were going.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Plenty, but a friend of mine said, let's go join Milliways.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And that's how it started.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 First time at Milliways and this year due to some interesting things going on in our own organization,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 at GPN a few friends of mine came up to me, hey, we could need someone to run the Milliways kitchen.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 So I said, yeah, let's see.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And it was very little time to plan the kitchen.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 It's worth pointing out at this point that Milliways has been going for pretty much nearly 20 odd years.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So this organization has been through several iterations.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 People coming, people going.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Yeah, people coming, people going, people having kids, getting on with their real lives.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Because the camps and events are annual or biannual, you kind of see the same people,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 but they're like little snapshots into their lives.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And of course, we're all very good over the years.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Those of us who have been around forever, we're all very good friends now.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And I think it's actually really helped to build the -- the whole computer hacker scene or movement is actually very,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 very different compared -- depending on where you are around the world.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 The U.S. tends to be very tech-centric.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 It tends to be very Silicon Valley-centric.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Germany, on the other hand, and you know, it tends to be far more politically oriented because of the --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 because of the history of the CCC and where it comes from.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 And the Dutch and the British are kind of somewhere in the middle and, you know, everybody else.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 It's a big old mess.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 But one of the things -- one of the really interesting things is that when you bring all these people together

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 with all of their alternate viewpoints, you actually have a really interesting

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 and productive discussion about, okay, well, you know, who's -- right is the wrong word.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 But it's like, for example, the European -- in the case of the European Union, the European Union is very big on regulation.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 The U.S., on the other hand, is very not big on regulation.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And you have people from two radically different points of view and who work, generally speaking,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 for very large -- for companies that come from radically different places, actually sort of like stick them in a field together, right?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Shove a bunch of beer in them, like, and then give them soup, right?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And that pretty much forces them to talk, right?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 And after you've spent, like, an hour, like, chopping stuff with somebody else,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 by the end of that, you're either really bored or you've made a new friend, you know?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 And that new friend might well come from somewhere completely different.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 So when you say --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 But there's also something I need to emphasize.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So last camp, I went with a couple of friends, and it was great, yes,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 but this time I'm just meeting so many people.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 There are so many new faces.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 And maybe we didn't fully talk about how do you get to Millyways.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 We are very open about this.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 You don't need a friend who tells you, "Hey, let's join Millyways together."

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 On our Matrix chat, random people showed up in the last few weeks.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 "Hey, I would like to join Millyways. Can I be in?"

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 We were like, "Hey, welcome to Millyways. You're one of us now."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 The only constriction now is our camping grounds.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 There's nowhere space.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 If you plan on joining Millyways for one of the next camps,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 there is, I think, a Wiki or Matrix channel.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Basically, say, "Yeah, I would like to come by."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 It's not a regulation thing. It's just how much space do we need?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 How much space do we need?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 You don't have to start packing the tents three-dimensionally.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Basically, the minimum skill level is,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 can you peel a potato without killing yourself?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 That's it. It's very low.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 And even then, you can still do the dishes or whatever.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Yes, if you can't, we'll find something else.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 So it's not just, I want to come back to the topic of food and food preparation.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 So it's not like you have a kitchen team that does all the cooking.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It's a communal thing. How does it work?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 It's communal. It's logic communal.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Today, actually, our Spanish friends took over the kitchen.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 We had planned this together.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 I think everyone was really happy about the food.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 The line went all the way to Jugendhackt.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 I think when we're talking about the food,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 it's really important to give a sense of scale.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 So you say, "Okay, we have a kitchen. We cook food."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 What does that mean?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Well, we plan two meals a day for the duration of camp,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 some stuff during build-up, some stuff during tear down,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 for this year, approximately 500 people.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And that is an immense logistical effort,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 which I get to take absolutely no credit for this year,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 which I'm very happy that I don't have to take credit for that logistical effort.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And to get everything in order from the suppliers months in advance,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 making sure that not only are there things for people to eat,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 but that there's things that people can eat,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 figuring out what recipes scale,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 how to cook those recipes with people who are not professional chefs,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 aren't necessarily working as professional sous chefs or something like that,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 in a way that is in conformity with the health and safety regulations

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 that nobody gets hurt or poisoned or worse or anything like that,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 is a giant lift, which Zornam has quietly avoided taking credit for,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 but let's loudly give her the credit for pulling this off.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 So far, no one is poisoned.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 So far.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Over the years, when it started out, I was catering for, what, 100 people?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah, so I took it from a small ad hoc to approximately,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 very nearly the size it is now,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and then I got busy with real life.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And I said, "OK, I'll hand it on to somebody else."

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 But things have been going for 20 odd years, right?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So that's plenty of time to go, "OK, done now. Hand it off to somebody else."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And then old people like me,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 we just hover around and help out and try not to be a nuisance.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 So if someone wants to try and mill it away, you mentioned the Matrix channel.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Is there a website?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Yeah, there's a wiki and stuff.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 The wiki.info is the URL.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 There is wiki and all sorts of other information about the organization.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 But I think, and I heard it a couple of times,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 just show up and have the right open attitude.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 I mean, the concept behind the camp is all creatures are welcome,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 and that certainly applies to us.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Show up, volunteer, be present, and have a good time.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Yeah, I just talk.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 I mean, like, you know, if you hide in your tent,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 nothing happens, right? Exactly.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 So come and volunteer.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Chop some onions.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Chop some onions, chop some potatoes.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 But I mean, or simply actually the easiest thing to do, right,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 is, okay, so you're a new person that you've decided to take the plunge,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 and you're going to come to one of these events,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 like whether it's camp, whether it's Congress, whatever, right?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 You don't know anybody, and it's like, right,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 I need to go make some friends.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 The easiest thing you can do is, here, is certainly,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 is show up with a plate and a knife and a fork, right?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Roughly about meal time, serving meal time, right?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 The way the system works is that we don't--

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 just like "Milly Way" is in the book and the TV show--

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 BBC TV series. Yeah, et cetera.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 You never have to pay at "Milly Way"

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 because if you've ever had one penny in an account at any point,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 for the magic of compound interest, by the end of the universe,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 you have an infinite amount of money, so therefore, it's fine.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 So we don't charge.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 We ask for a donation, obviously, because we still have to cover our costs.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 But just show up and eat, and just sit at a table and just talk to people.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 That's it. It's the easiest thing in the world.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 No obligations.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 No obligations. It's literally the easiest thing in the world,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 and it's one of these things where it's like you sit down,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 rub elbows to people, drink the soup, eat the bread, talk.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And that's it.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 So I think it makes sense to come back to this topic of handover.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 So there's a problem that a lot of hobbies and interests

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 and those kind of organizations have,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 which is you have a group of people, and there's a certain culture,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 and you need to understand the culture to get into it,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 and then eventually those people gray out,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 and because they're this sort of closed-off thing

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 that's a little bit scary, a little bit, "Mm, we don't like outsiders,"

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 eventually it dies off and then it goes away.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 The fact that Milly Ways has lived more than a very short time,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 more than 20 years, as you said,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 is a testament to the fact that that is the polar opposite of how things work.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 People show up one year, they eat food.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 They make some friends, they come to the next event,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 they volunteer in the kitchen, they have a great time.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 They do that a couple times in a row,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and then maybe they take over the kitchen for one night,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 and they do that again, and they start to really look forward to it,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 and maybe they take some other responsibility.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 This year, instead of taking over a night in the kitchen,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 I ended up responsible for the entire stage.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 (laughter)

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And the other thing as well, of course,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 is that all of that interaction also feeds back then

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 into what else you learn along the way,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 because clearly it's like, "Let's chop potatoes

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 and talk about BGP."

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 For example, I mean, that's deeply nerdy,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 but it could be anything.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Literally, it's like, "Are you interested in the intersection

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 between politics and, say, I don't know, surveillance society?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 How we structure human relations in the age

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 where everything is technologically mediated?"

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Whatever. You pick it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 You can talk about it, and you will find someone else

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 who is interested in what you are interested in.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 But just to circle back, to make this really clear for the audience,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 that has not been to any of these events like EMF camp,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 CCC camp, there is no obligation to pitch in.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 No.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Show up.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Show up.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Show up. And that's basically why I take it, then show up.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 You're not going to get the sort of guilty looks where people are like,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 "Hmm, we've been keeping track, and you haven't been doing anything,"

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 and there's not the sort of, "Oh, there's that person who's come to 10 events

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 and never helped."

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 There's really no obligation.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 But also, I don't even think that's how people in Millyways work,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 because when we go out there and we're like,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 "Oh, we really need some people to this or that right now,"

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 someone is always there.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Always volunteers.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 I'm just trying to make sure that everyone understands

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 the barrier of entry is very low.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Basically, buy a ticket, get a tent, and show up.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Show up.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And manage not to kill yourself peeling a potato.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 It's like, can you wash a dish?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Can you peel a potato without killing yourself?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 It's a very low bar.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So basically, you can train until the next camp to match that.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Can you boil an egg?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Well, in all honesty, depending...

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Oh, that's a ho.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 In all honesty, depending on the day you're doing this,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 you may learn how to peel potatoes in one day.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 After 25 kilos of potatoes, you know how to peel them.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 You better be good at this.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I mean, quite seriously.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 So it's one of these things.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 The whole tech and hackathon in general actually kind of really

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 has a bit of a cultural problem in that its perception is,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 you know, it's really shaped by the media,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 and we really don't help ourselves.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 We all dress in black.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 We all have, like, mostly weird hair.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 I have weird hair.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Thanks.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 You know, you probably are old enough to have lost most of your weird hair,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 but you'd have weird hair if you could.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 You know, we mostly dress in black, and the rest of it,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 apart from Zoram, who's very helpfully trying to break that stereotype,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 it's overwhelmingly male-dominated,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 and it talks in a weird, arcane language

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 that is very difficult for outsiders to really penetrate.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 But in fact, actually, it is probably more important than ever

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 that people who are interested,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 even if they don't have a technical background,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 actually show up to these things,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 because technology really permeates and undergirds the entire frame

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 in which we now experience modern life.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And if you don't understand that environment that sits underneath you,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 it's like a fish's understanding of water,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 or a bird's understanding of air.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Unless you actually understand what those things are,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 then you can't actually understand the way in which the ways that you think

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 and the ways that you act and the people around you act, clearly.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 And as Goethe once put it, none are more completely enslaved

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 than those that falsely believe they are free.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 And really, this is kind of what a lot of this is actually about.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 It's like, let us understand the air and the water,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 the contemporary air and water composed of electrons through which we swim,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 with which we breathe.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 And on that bombshell we will end this show now.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 No. Thanks.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And there's also feedback the other way around, right?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 If someone from outside the field shows up and talks to you,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 you have to rethink how you phrase things, how you explain things,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 how do you explain to someone how BGP or whatever works.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 You used the word "if."

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I think it's very important to underline,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 it's not if someone from outside of the field shows up.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 When?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 They're here.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Yes, thankfully.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Yes, absolutely.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Next to us, we are sandwiched this year between the Jugendhack,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 so young and upcoming people who are security researchers,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 and the family village.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 And they are perfectly wonderful, lovely people,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 and the Jugendhack people are, let's say, the hackers of tomorrow,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 the security researchers, the people in Infosec,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 and a lot of people in the family village, some one of the family is,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 and the other people are absolutely not.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Just regular people.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 We're regular people too.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 But they're more regular.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 For several bodies of regular, yeah.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 They're more regular.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 And so it's not that they're coming here just to humor their family members,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 they're coming here because they also are learning something,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 participating, interacting with the event, getting benefit from the event,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 providing benefit to the event, and this event and all of the events with Miloways,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 the whole idea is you're having this mixing of people from all over the different places,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 the different security areas, the different parts of the world,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 and this exchange of idea and information is a net positive for everyone.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 The sum is greater than the whole.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 I'd also strongly suggest, I'd strongly advocate for more people,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 more people with disabilities showing up,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 more people from more places around the world, not just the privileged white world.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Sorry, you're privileged white guys.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And I'm proxy privileged white guy.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And more ethnic minorities.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And for a very good reason.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It's because in general people solve for the experiences,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 for the problems that they experience.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 And the problem with technology is that technology is so often made up by

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 white able-bodied men.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So you end up solving for problems that are experienced by white able-bodied rich men.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Like can't get a taxi in San Francisco, well I made Uber,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 can't get a cheap hotel room wherever, so I made Airbnb and so on and so forth.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Now all of that is fucking meaningless if you are from Sierra Leone,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 or if you're disabled.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And what we actually need to do is bring more of these people in to learn the skills and thought processes

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 to then enable them to solve for the problems that they experience.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And then feed that back also into how we build literally the world around us.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 And that's the feedback loop we have at CCC Camp and all the other events as well.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 What did we do right, what did we do wrong, how can we improve?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 And the broader the audience, the broader the spectrum of people we get into these events,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 the better it becomes.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And the more we understand, okay what did we not experience, what did we forget, what did we not see?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Who did we not include?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Who's missing?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 So again, Milly Ways is a perfectly good environment.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 We really try and actually, we really very much go out of our way to invite people from right across the spectrum

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 to just show up, you know.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And you know, it's more important, given the pivotal role that technology really has adopted in our lives,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 it's more important than ever than the people who are actually creating, implementing,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 and inventing literally the future around us actually get experience and live the world through the eyes of others.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 And that's actually very, very hard because you know, like it's an extremely neurodiverse community.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And what that actually means is that very often people actually get kind of like a bit of autistic tunnel vision.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And we don't necessarily see the world through other people's eyes.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 And events like this is actually a very low stress way of actually being able to see the world through somebody else's eyes.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Here's a really stupid, trivial example.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 I was talking to a friend here who is disabled and she can't reach the buttons in the shower because she's too short.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I found out about that today when I was taking a shower because there was a woman with her daughter right next to me.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 And she was like, oh, I need to go to a different one because I can't reach it.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 I'm really tall.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And I was like, that's what those wooden blocks and those ropes are for.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 I didn't know what they were for.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Right?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 But it's like it's but it's this very important thing where it's like now unless unless that person had ever shown up,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 we would actually not really ever realize that that barrier was there.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Yeah.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 But unfortunately, this is also an example of how slow we sometimes learn because we had the same issue four years ago at the last.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Yeah, well, that's we didn't improve on that yet.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Yeah, that's that's that's on you.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Yeah.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 But that's not really that's not really so let's let's part of setting up the stage this year for organizational reasons.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 A lot of the the organization of the infrastructure was pushed out from the core CCC into the villages.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 And so in putting together the stage, the first thing is, OK, how can we have a fantastic stage where the presenter can give an amazing talk and look good and make all of us look good and share their information?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And the second thing is, how can we accommodate as many people as possible?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And the CCC has an organization which takes a special care that people with disabilities are able to enjoy that not just things like there's a place for people with wheelchairs,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 but also for people that have issues seeing that there's reserved spaces that the design and the layout of the stage facilitates people with mobility issues getting in and out, especially in case of an emergency or something like that.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And just all of these things that as an able bodied white man in the Western world aren't the first thing that you think about.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And the as much as you can sort of imagine, right, you say, OK, I don't have this problem, but I could imagine that this might be a problem.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 That's nothing compared to the accumulated experience of the people that have those issues and need those accommodations.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And we weren't able to do everything that we wanted to do to accommodate everyone, which is our bad, not the Congress's.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 And we will do better next time.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 And we will continue to do better until there's nothing to do better at the end of the universe when money is infinite and we don't have we have other problems.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 We can afford the dinner at the end of the universe.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Which is also infinitely expensive.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Because, you know, I think that that's I think that's I think that's absolutely right.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And I think as time goes on, the more the more people with the more view with more viewpoints and that you can bring in and with more experiences that you can bring in so much the better.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And then that actually has a cross fertilization effect then out into wider society.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 More people then understand the way that the way that the tech folks work and the tech folks actually understand more of the way that the real world works.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And then hopefully then they'll actually go out and solve problems that are actually really socially meaningful.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Right.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 We're a little bit pressed for time.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 I have two topics I want to touch on.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 No, it's totally fine.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Thank you very much.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 It's awesome.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 You mentioned already when we talked about the food that you asked for donations.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Where does this Millie Way coin come in?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Does this is this is this your way of asking for donations?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Is this a completely different thing?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 It's it's actually history because challenge coins in the US are really, really, really, really common.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And I have to drop you here.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 You have to explain the concept of a challenge coin.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Okay.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 What are Europeans?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 I don't.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 I totally didn't bring any because because I failed behind the couch.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 So, okay.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 So challenge coins come from actually they come from the US services.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And the idea is it's basically you you're like you're a former Marine or whatever.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 And the rest of it.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And it's like you pull out your challenge coin and everybody else who is in your organization or in your unit and the rest of it has to put their challenge coin.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 If they don't have it, whoever didn't have it has to buy the round drinks.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Right.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 So that goes all the way back to the Vietnam War.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 But that in the States has kind of like bled over into everything else.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 So now at hack a cons right there were all these challenge coins going around because all of the units and the rest of it, you know, have their own challenge coins.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 So that bled out into wide society.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And so that idea ended up coming here.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 So but that does kind of that culture doesn't exist here.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 So what they ended up becoming was a collectible.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 So because they've now been so many events, right, you can literally have a whole collection of these coins, which we have designed by a different designer for each event.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 And, you know, it's kind of like become, you know, got a Pokemon, got to collect them all.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 So they're effectively a memento, but they're also represent a way to basically support support what we're doing right in a way that, again, doesn't obligate anybody to do anything, doesn't obligate.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 But you get a very cool little like like souvenir effectively of the event that you went to as well as unforgettable memories.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Let's, you know, I just and they go in the dark.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Yes, fine. Close in the dark. It does glow in the dark. Yeah.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Something that's important. And I need to be a little bit careful in my word choice.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 And so, you know, Millerways is an organization does not have a bank account. And so the things that we do, the infrastructure that we build, the experiences that people share are born shared across Millerways.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 As nice as it is to have the opportunity to go into the individual people's bank accounts to be able to provide these things.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 It's also nice to be able to say at the end, hey, we were able to cover our costs and everything's going to be all right.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And because there's this there are no expectations. As far as I know, there's never been a huge loss where people were out of pocket for huge sums of money.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 The only real thing that we have that we can say, hey, thank you for supporting us is the challenge coin.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 So it's not that, hey, you come to the event and you buy the coin and you're buying your way into the village.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 That's not at all the point. But rather, hey, you come, you had a good time. You want to support what we're doing. Great.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Here's a souvenir. And that helps us defray the costs of doing all of this.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Even if you do not stay with Millerways, come back, get the coin, support the correct. It's a cool design.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 You got a cool design. And then after a while, got to collect them all.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 So basically walk by, walk by really ways, find someone who looks bored like you did this afternoon.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 No, no, no, do not come and find me. I do not find people that look bored.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 We have a really interesting and fun info desk.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 We didn't think it would be finished before Friday, but it's there now.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 So most likely during the day you will find someone who will sell you coins there and if not, ask for it or go to the sticker box.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 So, yes, do not wake anyone up for them, right? Yeah, that would be nice.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 One last thing I experienced over the last events before the unspeakable time was there was an evening of coming together at Millerways where some beverages were consumed.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Oh, you mean Whiskey League? Yes.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 Whiskey League started out as kind of like a fundraiser for the legal defenses of various people and now it's just become like that original purpose went in the trash years ago because, you know, it turned out that some people were assholes.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And now it's just turned into show up with whiskey and drink it.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 It's another excellent chance to socialize.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 So you want to bring your own bottle?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 No, so the way it works is that if you have something interesting that you'd like to share, please bring it.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 It's not your bottle. Just throw it into the pile and it'll get drunk.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Or alternatively, if you want to just come up and just have a taste, show up with a cup, you know, like have a, you know, like drink something interesting outside of your normal.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 This year I found a bottle of whiskey from India, which is a mixture of like Indian, distilled in India, but made with a mixture of Indian like grain grown up on the hill of Malaya's and smoked scotch malt.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 So it's going to taste really weird.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 But weird is interesting and good. Right?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 And so whiskey leaks is one of the things that Millie Weiss organizes.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 There are people who camp with Millie Weiss who don't drink alcohol.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 There are people who camp with Millie Weiss who don't smoke, who are vegan, who there are people who eat only meat, smoke cigarettes constantly.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 And I haven't seen them sober in a decade.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 It's not that there's this particular type of person that belongs or and you know what?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 If whiskey leaks isn't your thing, there's something else going on.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 So we have a stall that started today that is serving alcohol free chunk.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 We have a whole espresso escalation.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 There can never be too much espresso. No, no, no.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 There is too much.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 We challenge you to empty it.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 It's also kind of like an international alarms race here.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 You have the Europeans.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 We have the best coffee.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And the folks from Seattle are like, no, we have the best coffee.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 And that's kind of escalated into kind of like a very strange competition.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 There are also other competitions like Titanium Chef, which is kind of like a weird challenge thing that happened at tour camp several years ago.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 There's all sorts of just like variously bonkers things, you know, which are highly entertaining.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 We just encourage people just again to show up for.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 I mean, we put the British next to the Scottish this year.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 There's also an Irish contingent as well.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 And it's kind of interesting because, again, you know, like what you have is also an environment where people actually just realize they will just get on.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 They will just share real just common interests.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 You know, national borders and the rest of it are kind of a bit of a joke.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 You might have some fun with it, but yeah, exactly.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 It's an implementation detail.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 And thanks for bringing up all the other events.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 I just Whiskey Leaks is one example.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 And of course, just show up and have fun and talk to people.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 I think tonight we will have some a lot of culinary surprises as well.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 I mean, dinner time is finished already as far as I understand, but we have some more plans for today.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 There's also midnight fries.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Yes. Literally midnight fries.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 It's midnight.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 You've been out partying all night and the rest of it wet because, you know, it's the classic thing of, you know,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 like it's three a.m. in the morning.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 The clubs have just done.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 I'm just done with clubbing and the rest of it.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 I need something greasy.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 And of course, on a campsite, there is no kebab.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So now it's just like, right.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 OK, like we implemented midnight fries.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 So thanks for that information.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 I think I will have to drop by.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 The thing about midnight fries is it's not that there's somebody with with their watch and say, oh, it's midnight.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 It's time to make the fries.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 There's a kitchen.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 There's the pot.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 There's the oil.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 There's the fries.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 There's the first person who says, you know what, it it feels like it's time for midnight fries.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Gets midnight fries going.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 And then from nowhere, a swarm of people come and help and then eat and then go back to wherever they went.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 And hopefully, other people come and clean up.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Hopefully clean up.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 I've had to clean that fry too many times.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 So we are almost hitting our time marks.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Any any last remarks from each of you on on Millieways, why people should come by, why people should come to the next event where Millieways is?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Show up. We're nice.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 That's it.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Just show up. We're nice.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 What's the quote?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Mostly harmless.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Mostly harmless.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 Show up. We're nice.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 You know, that really is it.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 It's a group of people who are mostly nice and they cook occasionally.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Yeah.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 I'd also say we add another level of chaos with that international angle.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 We're a camp within the camp with sub camps that also have sub camps.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Yeah, I know. It's kind of it's getting weird.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 In a good way.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 I mean, the other thing is, is that it's changed out of all recognition over the last 20 years and it will keep changing.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 And really, actually, if you know, like, be the be the be the change you'd like to see.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Right. So if you find if you as a person find, you know, the world around you really interesting, you're curious about other people, you're curious about other cultures, just show up.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 And once you get stuck in, literally become the change that you wish to see in the world.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 You're the future of Millieways.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Yeah.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Come find out what exactly that means together with all of us.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Well, I think there's nothing to add.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 We will cut it short here.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Thank you very much.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 So this was Zornheim, Kralln and Amazon for Millieways.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 This was another episode of Chaos Family.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Thank you very much for watching and hopefully we will see you soon.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Have a great day.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Cheers.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:32.000
