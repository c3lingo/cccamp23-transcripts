00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 So

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,680
 welcome to the Chaos Communication Camp 23.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,360
 Again, this is the Bitz and Boimer stage.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,320
 And we have the next talk happening over here

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,920
 about open hardware and solar energy and open MPT project.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,320
 And for that, I would like to welcome the Elektrowagenrat.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,360
 >> Correct, that's correct.

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360
 >> From Berlin, who is active in the local Freifunk community for

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,960
 a long time there and- >> 20 years.

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,320
 >> 20 years, and we will have some short Q&A in the end.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,000
 The talk is 20 minutes.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,280
 It's in English, there's no German translation, sorry.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,600
 >> [APPLAUSE]

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,240
 >> Thank you very much.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,320
 Thank you very much for coming.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,800
 So as this is a short talk and I have 16 slides,

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,840
 it also comes down to what you know about the project.

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,520
 So it's an open software and open hardware project that

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,880
 you should be able to build yourself around the planet.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
 And it should help you in many situations where you need

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,880
 independence from energy.

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,040
 It started in 2017, during the time when Freifunk was supporting refugees,

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,880
 in the refugee crisis, where people were living in informal camps.

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,400
 And they had no electricity and they had no communication basically.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,640
 So we were thinking, how can we bring to informal refugee camps in the field

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,680
 somewhere solar powered energy and solar powered connectivity.

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
 We were mostly concerned about the connectivity,

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
 setting up independent wireless routers.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,440
 That's how it started in 2017 and the project has evolved quite a lot.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,600
 There's now three different devices that I have engineered over time.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,240
 So it started in 2017, Mark 1.

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,880
 It is a 50 watt peak maximum power point tracker.

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,080
 Who of you does not know what a maximum power point tracker does?

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,680
 All right, I will be brief, but it's a complex subject to explain.

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,120
 If you run a solar module, you have a certain voltage where the module

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,200
 creates the most power, where the power output of the solar

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,840
 generator is the most efficient.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,560
 If you connect it to a battery in an autonomous system,

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,800
 without a maximum power point tracker in between, the battery will just suck

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
 down the generator to the voltage of the battery while it is charging.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
 Which means, for example, you have a panel that produces 30 volts at maximum power.

43
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,520
 And you connect it to a 12 volt battery and then the voltage in the solar panel

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,360
 drops down to the level of the battery.

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,000
 And the current amazingly stays almost the same.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,120
 So if you could harvest 30 volts and one ampere, you will harvest 12 volts and

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,920
 one point a tiny bit of little more amperes.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,000
 So you will lose a lot of the power.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,440
 And a maximum power point tracker can help this.

50
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,920
 It can detect at which voltage the generator is the most happy and

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,120
 can produce the most power.

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,600
 And then it uses a step down converter, in my case, and

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,360
 tracks the voltage of the solar panel so it stays in that maximum power point.

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,800
 And then transforms it down to the level of the battery.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,080
 And the result is that the current that charges the battery is increasing.

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,960
 Like in a 30 volt panel,

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,480
 it can be more than double the current that comes from the solar panel.

58
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,880
 So what you see here is Mark 1, actually the first prototype.

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,640
 I've etched it myself and of course you can find the files on the internet.

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,280
 And actually if you have a workshop and you know how to etch PCBs,

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,480
 then you can etch it yourself.

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
 You need a drill and a soldering iron and the components.

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,480
 You download the files.

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,840
 You print them on a laser printer.

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,240
 You use them to expose it to photosensitized PCB material.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,280
 And you can etch it yourself.

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,840
 Or you just order PCBs from a manufacturer.

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,640
 So Mark 1 was designed to be used in combination with a wireless router

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,880
 running OpenWRT.

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,960
 The idea was to make the smallest and cheapest solar node

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,480
 that is energy autonomous for an entire year in the area of Berlin, for example.

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,120
 And you can monitor it from afar.

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,240
 So you deploy it somewhere and you can connect to that OpenWRT based router.

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,880
 And you can read the data from the maximum power point tracker.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,720
 You can check the charge of the battery and so on.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:55,320
 In 2018, three people including me,

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,760
 we got a grant from the prototype fund in their third round.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080
 So we could work on a web app and

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,560
 other software in OpenWRT, Lua programs,

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,960
 to do this monitoring and data aggregation.

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,080
 And that program needed a name, so it was called iSIMS,

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,560
 Independent Solar Energy Mesh System.

83
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:33,080
 So this is how we figured out would be a good way for

84
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,840
 such a mobile disaster recovery node.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,600
 A solar panel at the ground, a telescopic mast, and

86
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,200
 on top a waterproof router with Wi-Fi and mesh capability.

87
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,720
 On the right side you see a little screenshot from the app.

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,880
 And it shows you the situation of that node.

89
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,640
 It's a node on the roof of my hut.

90
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
 And it's just showing the system is fine.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,400
 It is supposed to give information that even if you're not too

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,200
 technically skilled, you learn something about the health of your system.

93
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,000
 And then came Mark II.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,320
 I thought to further reduce the cost for some situations.

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,680
 For example, you live in a village that is cut off from the internet pretty much.

96
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
 And there's a hill between you and

97
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,760
 another place where you can get internet from via wireless.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,120
 You could use a device that is based on the ESP32 chip that has Wi-Fi on board.

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,080
 As a Wi-Fi relay.

100
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,640
 So it became optional to add that open WT based router because

101
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,760
 the second generation became self-sufficient with regards to Wi-Fi.

102
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 It cannot do completely mesh networking.

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,320
 It can do routing now.

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,240
 But it doesn't need the extra power to power an open WT based router.

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,400
 And it still gives you some megabytes per second in relaying traffic between

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,920
 two places if the RF signal is strong enough.

107
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,640
 Are you okay?

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 [LAUGH]

109
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
 I hope I'm not boring you at all.

110
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,480
 [LAUGH]

111
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,840
 So and then people came and said, well,

112
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,000
 that ESP32 chip that has the Wi-Fi on board, it has many unused GPIOs.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,600
 Please, why don't you expose these?

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,880
 We could use it for sensors and for whatnot.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,720
 And people were asking, hey, why do you only want to power wireless routers?

116
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
 We need more power.

117
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,080
 Give us more power.

118
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,520
 Which was out of the scope of what I initially intended to do with this project.

119
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,520
 But I said, okay, well, it opens up the possibility to use it for

120
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,280
 other things as well, sensors, you will see a few examples later.

121
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,560
 Why not?

122
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,520
 So I extended the design, added one more pin header, and

123
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,080
 increased the power, I doubled it basically.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,800
 But this wasn't the end, because people were saying, why only 100 watt peak?

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,080
 We need more power.

126
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,560
 Initially, I had thought, okay, there is commercial maximum

127
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,920
 PowerPoint trackers on the market that you can buy from companies.

128
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,160
 I don't mention those companies.

129
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,880
 But of course, there's a virtue in having an open source and

130
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,920
 open hardware project that you can extend and hack on.

131
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,120
 The devices, since I used the ESP32, you can tell it into the machine.

132
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,440
 Sorry, no SSH, but you can tell it into the machine.

133
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,880
 You can FTP programs into the machine or download it from there.

134
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,080
 You have, of course, a website, you have a web interface,

135
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,520
 you have MQTT protocol as a telemetry.

136
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,120
 You can configure it that it sends to two MQTT servers, its data.

137
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
 So you can monitor it from everywhere and

138
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,440
 you can run your own server to monitor it locally.

139
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,400
 And of course, since the device now expanded to, yeah,

140
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,360
 a device you can also use stationary, I also added the option to have a display

141
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,920
 in the 3D printed housing, so you can also 3D print your housing.

142
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,480
 But please use flame retardant PETG,

143
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,400
 because it's strong electronics, high currents.

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,920
 In the worst case, when you have like full power from the sun coming in and

145
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,980
 full power demanded from the battery it can deliver up to 50%

146
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,710
 50 amperes to your consumers.

147
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,190
 So that's a current you can use for welding.

148
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:14,070
 And the peak currents inside the device, they can go to 30 amperes at 400 watts peak.

149
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:23,870
 So that's why you see this massive inductor coil which is used as the transformer.

150
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:32,870
 Step number two of this device has been tried in an experiment in Ant Hill in India.

151
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,710
 Because what can you do with 400 watts peak solar power?

152
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,470
 You can run a small server and have a community that doesn't have internet access and give

153
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,110
 them local services like local Wikipedia, local video streaming and whatnot.

154
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,430
 So this is another nice addition.

155
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,070
 The software running on the Frink Center is Nimble, it's another project.

156
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:04,150
 I don't know if Eric who is involved in the project is around.

157
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,510
 Two pictures of India, from India and also pictures that I use, I'm going to use in the

158
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:18,370
 printed documentation how not to use the device.

159
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,510
 The people in Ant Hill, they have built a bamboo tower with a metal housing where the

160
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,950
 sun is blaring on that metal housing.

161
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:35,310
 And they have put the batteries into the metal housing to make theft of the batteries more

162
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,570
 difficult.

163
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,030
 But at the same time they are frying the batteries.

164
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,910
 And they're also frying my electronics.

165
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,630
 The device is supposed to be mounted upright so you have some cool air streams to cool

166
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:54,270
 that powerful inductor because at full power only the inductor can produce five watts of

167
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,070
 heat and that heat has to go somewhere.

168
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:04,670
 It's not supposed to be accumulated in that housing.

169
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:13,510
 And then people came again and said, you know, why not build a device for watering plants

170
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,390
 independently?

171
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:22,710
 So I built a prototype based on the 100 watt version for irrigation.

172
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,430
 So it measures humidity of the soil.

173
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,710
 It controls water valves.

174
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,990
 It controls a pump to provide water to the system.

175
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:40,310
 And it also has a tank gauge to measure the amount of water that is remaining in the tank.

176
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,750
 And of course it sends everything via MQTT protocol to the service you like so you can

177
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,750
 monitor it.

178
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,990
 I think this is quite helpful.

179
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,950
 At the moment it's a prototype made with wiring on an existing device.

180
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:01,350
 But I consider also making a PCB for this purpose.

181
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,110
 Just yeah.

182
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:14,050
 In last autumn I took these pictures that these are these drop irrigation outlets.

183
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,870
 You can save a lot of water and you can treat your plants really well with this.

184
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,350
 I learned I'm not too much into gardening that you should water your plants about one

185
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,870
 hour before the sun goes up in the morning.

186
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,670
 That's the best time where you avoid fungi growing on your plants and the water is used

187
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,910
 most effectively.

188
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,690
 And in times of drought, yeah, that might be a really good thing.

189
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,750
 So I promised not to talk too much and spend too much time.

190
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,910
 So I thank you for your interest.

191
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,630
 And now we're ready for questions and answers.

192
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:07,630
 [Applause]

193
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,830
 So we have some questions.

194
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,910
 So raise your hands so that we can see you and then we try to accommodate as many as

195
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,230
 we can in five minutes.

196
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:28,350
 Hi, are the design files or the schematics for the Mark II or Mark III available anywhere?

197
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:36,830
 Mark II is available at electra.info and then you go to the site and you go to ffesp32.

198
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,190
 I have not published Mark III because I'm not completely done with the development yet.

199
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:50,350
 And if you want to produce them, please contact me for the latest files and also the support

200
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,550
 with some of the components.

201
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,350
 Because the chip crisis and the resource crisis also hit me.

202
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:05,430
 I'm still waiting for some power inductors for like two months now.

203
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,230
 Over there to the back.

204
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:16,270
 If you raise your hands a little bit earlier, we can be prepared where we need to appear

205
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,270
 after.

206
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,270
 And you have to talk because it's a long way for the microphone to reach the next question.

207
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,270
 And there we go.

208
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,470
 Hi, first of all, thank you for all of this.

209
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:33,830
 I have a good idea about what an MPP tracker is doing, but I have no clue how it is doing

210
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,830
 it.

211
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,190
 Could you maybe elaborate a bit on the implementation and how you specifically achieved this?

212
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:44,150
 Do you know what a DC/DC buck converter does and how it works?

213
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:51,150
 So basically you have in a standard DC/DC buck converter you have a feedback loop that controls

214
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,150
 the output.

215
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,630
 And there's just yet another feedback loop which is controlling the input.

216
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:05,430
 So the pulse width modulation is controlled by the voltage at the input and finally when

217
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,190
 you reach the charge end level at the output.

218
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,790
 So because a standard buck converter you can try this without such an outer feedback control

219
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,510
 loop it will just try to suck as much current as it gets and then you still have the same

220
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:27,070
 effect like well it's even worse than just connecting your battery to the solar panel

221
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,790
 without a DC/DC buck converter in between.

222
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,910
 Other than that of course it's a solar controller as well so it protects your battery from overcharging

223
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,990
 and deep discharging which would damage the batteries.

224
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:46,590
 Oh, but I forgot to mention so far I have been using AGM led batteries but at the moment

225
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:57,270
 I'm working on LiFePO, so lithium iron phosphate batteries and modify the charge controller

226
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,270
 in the software.

227
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,550
 I don't need to do anything in the hardware.

228
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
 Any questions?

229
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,550
 More questions?

230
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,550
 I see this guy.

231
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,270
 Oh there, yes.

232
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,750
 What is the voltage for the batteries?

233
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,830
 Can you configure it and in which range?

234
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,830
 That's a very good question.

235
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:24,710
 No, at the moment it's 12 volts so you can charge up to 14.7 volts and you can control

236
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,230
 it from software.

237
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,910
 So use the chemistry you like.

238
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:36,670
 If I would make some changes for like 24 volt systems then the power capacity would double

239
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,670
 also.

240
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,870
 But I'm personally using systems like these and I prefer having like a single 12 volt

241
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,790
 battery rather than have several in a row but I know many people are saying well why

242
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:56,270
 not get 24 or 36 or 48 volts but at one point I'm going to do it probably and of course

243
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:05,830
 the challenge for people asking hey why only 400 watts, it continues.

244
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,670
 Okay anyone else?

245
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,310
 Otherwise I would have a last question then but go.

246
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,750
 Or tell if it's, sorry, I would repeat it otherwise.

247
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,630
 One very short question about the autonomy of your project in Berlin.

248
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,350
 You're told you can reach about 100% of autonomy.

249
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,670
 Which calculator did you use for that assumption?

250
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,310
 There's a manual.

251
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:38,030
 When you go to the Electra site there is a big one, it's like 52 pages and I'm trying

252
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,910
 to cover, well not everything but as much as I can and I like a printed documentation.

253
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,510
 Of course it's a PDF, you can print it out, whatever.

254
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,590
 Maybe I'll publish it as a book and people can buy it to support me.

255
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,630
 Sorry, I'm lost.

256
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,630
 Say it again.

257
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,630
 The calculator.

258
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,630
 The calculator.

259
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,710
 The calculator.

260
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:12,870
 I used, there is some global irrigation calculator and a very conservative estimate of the storage

261
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,230
 for these dark times.

262
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,910
 But it might, the weather changes if there is like three weeks of absolutely no sunshine

263
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:31,990
 where the cars drive at noon with the lights on, then of course it could happen.

264
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,190
 So I can guarantee 100%.

265
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,470
 So I have also a question.

266
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,270
 So commercial MPPTs are available of course but they are quite expensive too.

267
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:50,990
 And if I want to use it with like low power solar batteries that I get often from second

268
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,710
 hand market or something, it's not really feasible.

269
00:20:53,710 --> 00:21:00,390
 So how much is an invest to build open MPPT or like cheaply?

270
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,350
 The biggest one or just you pick the size that you want.

271
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,950
 When you build it on your own the question is how many are you going to build?

272
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,950
 Are you just building one or a few?

273
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:21,630
 I think if you order them in China, you can have them made in China, companies like Don

274
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,150
 mentioned, then it's fairly cheap.

275
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,190
 But of course you have to do some assembly.

276
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:33,790
 They wouldn't do through hole assemblies and you have to do some initial programming and

277
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,790
 so on.

278
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,230
 Probably for the 100 watt version maybe 35 euros.

279
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,830
 All in all.

280
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,470
 Thank you very much.

281
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,470
 Thank you very much.

282
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,470
 And that's our time.

283
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,470
 Thank you.

284
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,710
 Thank you.

285
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,710
 Thank you.

286
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,350
