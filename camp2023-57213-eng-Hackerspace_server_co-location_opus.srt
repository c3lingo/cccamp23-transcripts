3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:37,520
 Hi, we are here to talk about that in our hacker space in Copenhagen,

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,240
 we have a fiber connection and have a BDP setup and

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,960
 have a rack that looks like this next to our fridge with all our matter.

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,200
 And if we go a little bit closer,

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
 you can see that we have a lot of small single board computers.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,720
 And that's because that we have a lot of small bit devices.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,840
 But to go a little bit back, we have since 2017,

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,600
 had a fiber connection and had a BDP setup with a public ASN.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
 And we got a 24 sponsored by a friendly organization.

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,840
 So it's quite nice.

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,760
 And then we started doing members machines a little bit later.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,400
 So that members can have some more experience playing with network and

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,080
 BDP and routing and trying to have a machine on the Internet.

16
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,120
 And VPS is also available and stuff like that, but

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,600
 it's a bit more fun to have physical hardware.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 So yeah, low power devices and just best effort service,

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
 no service level agreement.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,160
 We have dual stack, so both IPv6 and IPv4.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,280
 And we have the ability to write your own IP addresses as well.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,960
 So we have some members that have their own mostly IPv6 space and their own ASNs.

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,880
 And we are currently around 15 machines on this setup.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,280
 But we expect it to be growing a bit soon.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,480
 But yeah, it's still small scale, but it's a fun, small,

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,400
 HackerSpace project.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
 So in order for us to cover some of the costs associated with it,

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,560
 like power wise, we have small monthly fee on it.

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,640
 But the main thing is just that we want people to also be full member of Laptap and

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,600
 have access to the HackerSpace and so on, so

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
 that they can service machines themselves and so on.

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:52,000
 But yeah, then Oliver wants to talk a bit about managing all these machines physically.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,720
 >> Yes, just a word of clarification.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,320
 This is not only for BGP playing, it is also just for micro hosting of any kind.

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,680
 So it might sound like it might need quite a bit of experience.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,640
 That's not the case.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,520
 You could just start with a pie and host your own services or a website or

38
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,280
 whatever that is.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,520
 So I want to talk a bit about the takeaways from five years of Labicolo.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
 The first one is the big one.

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,760
 The thing about computers are not made to live in large communities.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,440
 They are not made for scalability.

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,520
 They have cables sticking out in all four directions,

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,760
 sometimes a fifth if there's a header on it.

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:47,200
 They, We all know how that looks.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,800
 They, these power strips out there have many different kinds of

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,520
 small power supplies that can overheat and that can just fall out.

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,280
 All these things are quite challenging if it's in the same rack that

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,480
 you also need for infrastructure and where you want reliability.

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,920
 So the main takeaway is it needs to be managed.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,640
 And these are, this is a work in progress.

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,320
 If you want it to be accessible for many members, you need to,

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,320
 with very little complication, be able to add more devices pretty much spontaneously.

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,240
 And that only goes if that's, if it's not a huge spaghetti mess of loose cables,

55
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,120
 which the pictures don't show.

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
 That is right after tidying up.

57
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,400
 It is, believe me, it's super neat.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,280
 So what our idea is for the future is to make a kind of a campsite kind of setup

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,880
 where you come in from the back and each shelf has a little maybe ten port switch.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,080
 And then we can get away with very short cables.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,720
 So to keep it manageable.

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,600
 The main goal is to get more members on board that have a tiny machine and

63
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
 get to play with it.

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
 So more machines is the entire idea.

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,240
 More people that have more experience with small things on the internet.

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,800
 And more ASNs.

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:36,920
 >> Yeah, so if we look on BDP, then we are tied for

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,360
 the seventh largest neutral facility in Denmark.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
 So we hope to get up to the top four soon.

70
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,640
 And then the last thing is just that we have,

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,280
 there's another talk about our internet exchange on day three.

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,480
 And we have a meet up on day three after that as well to talk more about

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,440
 the BDP experiences and hack experiences.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
 >> Thank you.

75
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
 >> [APPLAUSE]
