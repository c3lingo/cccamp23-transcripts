00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:38,240
 [FOREIGN]

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:48,240
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,240
 >> Okay, actually, because this is a European issue, I would like to give this talk in English and there's a German translation.

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
 I hope that's fine.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,240
 I mean, [FOREIGN] like we could do both, but I thought it will do it in English.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 Is there anyone here who does not speak German?

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 There are a few.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Okay, good. Let's stick to English if that's okay.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 >> Is there someone who doesn't speak English?

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 >> Is there someone who doesn't speak English?

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,240
 The thing is, the translation is in German.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,240
 So you can really get those headsets and then that should work.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 Otherwise, if I use words you don't understand, just raise your hands.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
 I'm going to use the German equivalent.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,240
 There is a little bit of monetary lingua in there, so bear with me and I can translate it on the spot if you want.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,240
 So before we get started, a little bit about me.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
 My name is Thomas Lohninger.

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
 I'm executive director of AP Center Works.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 We are a Vienna-based digital rights NGO and I'm also vice president of EDRI.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 And all that we will talk about here is EU legislation, is binding law that will come our way in the next months and years.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
 And it's actually three laws that we'll cover here.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 First is the digital identity issue.

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,240
 There is a law where we are already two years into the process.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,240
 Then there is the digital euro and then there is also a third law, which is a right to access of cash, like bank notes and coins.

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 Something that is in many national debates, I think in Germany and Austria at the forefront.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,240
 And there will also be legislation about that.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 But we start with EEDAS, with the digital identity reform of the EU.

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 This is a regulation, so it's directly applicable in all EU countries.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 That means it will top any national law that we have, any national ID card in Germany, ID Austria.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 All of these things will be surpassed with this European system.

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
 And what actually is the plan of the EU?

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
 It's a full harmonization.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 So it should be one digital identity system that works across all 27 EU countries.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 And what it does, most importantly, is it establishes a European digital identity wallet.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,240
 So this piece of software, most likely an app on our smartphones, we are the holders of that app.

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,240
 And it will hold many attributes about us.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
 Our national ID, our driver license, our age, our COVID vaccinations.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 It's actually an open system when it comes to the attributes that can be contained within.

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 So it would be very easy for, for example, a hotel booking, your room key could be in there, your public transport card,

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 your credentials to log into your bank account, all of that.

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 And the system is also open to the other side, the so-called reliant parties.

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,240
 So it will be used with governments when you log in to do your taxes or any other type of filing.

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
 You could order a taxi with it.

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,240
 You might use it in order to prove that you have a hotel booking reservation or a restaurant table.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 Commerce is a very central part of that.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:56,240
 So it's not just for the public sector, it intentionally opens up digital identity from the state government issued to the private sector.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 And so this sentence sums it all up.

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 The function scope of this European digital identity wallet is a universal infrastructure to identify, authenticate,

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,240
 and verify attributes for legal and natural persons, so both companies as well as humans,

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 vis-a-vis the government and the private sector.

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,240
 And you can also sign legally binding any type of contract with that thing, and it will work online and offline.

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,240
 So in physical proximity or online with an Internet connection remotely.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
 And you already see, I think, the basic problem.

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,240
 This is one piece of technology that will be applied horizontally across all sectors.

57
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,240
 So it's easy to see why the government needs to know who you are when you do some filings with them.

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,240
 But it will also be used by mobile phone providers in order to verify who their customers are.

59
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
 They are legally obliged to do that.

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
 Similarly to the bank or notaries.

61
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,240
 Any type of age verification, if you want to buy tobacco or alcohol, or there are several proposals, as we'll see,

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 that oblige online platforms to do age verification.

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,240
 EEDAS might be the tool that you promote strongly for fulfilling these age verification use cases.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,240
 And importantly, we'll also see this in the media sector, so newspapers.

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 Wherever you have these Abramon subscriptions, you can pay 20 euros a month or just give us your consent.

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
 It will be used in these scenarios most likely as well.

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 And credit scoring like Schufa, public transport, all of these use cases besides Big Tech are also in the cards.

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 The EU is aiming by the end of this decade that 80% of all people are using this system.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
 So 80% penetration.

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
 And you can say roughly around 50-60%.

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
 It gets really interesting for the private sector to interface with that system.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,240
 Because I mean, it's basically a free, cheap way to identify your people, your users, your customers, your visitors.

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,240
 And that means any customer relationship management will jump on this thing.

74
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 But the EU also does specific stuff to promote the system.

75
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,240
 Any big online platforms like the ones you see here will be obliged to offer the wallet to log into their service.

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,240
 So you will use the European Digital Identity Wallet, or you will be able to, to log into Facebook, Amazon, and so forth.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,240
 As I mentioned, this is not something that happened yesterday.

78
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
 The law was proposed in June 2021.

79
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
 And here you see the timetable of everything that has happened in the European Parliament, in the Council.

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:36,240
 We are actually at the very final stage, the so-called "tri-log", where the three institutions, Parliament, Commission and Council, negotiate the final law.

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 We just had a kind of a huge victory end of June, where we could kill a few things.

82
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
 I'm going to talk about that later.

83
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
 And right now we have Spanish presidency.

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,240
 You might remember there was a snap election in Spain in July.

85
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
 New government is still formed.

86
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,240
 But we are expected that the Spanish will conclude the law.

87
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:02,240
 And by 2025 or 26, most likely the governments will be obliged to offer this wallet to their users, to their citizens.

88
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,240
 But some member states could choose to do it earlier.

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 What's driving this reform?

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
 Actually, a lot of suppose sufficiency gains.

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 Estonia is really popular with saying we have billions of public money that we are saving because we have digital identity.

92
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
 And those arguments are picked up by many other countries as well.

93
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,240
 So these sufficiency gains are a really strong reason for libertarians and conservatives to push for this reform.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,240
 A second important reason that you see throughout the EU is this blind digitization belief.

95
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
 Everything is better if it's done digital.

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,240
 Of course, the potential for control, for insight, for surveillance of all areas of life is huge with this system.

97
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,240
 If you can observe transactions, user behavior, I know when you look into Facebook, when you interact with the government,

98
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:02,240
 which travel routes you take, and even physical interactions if you would do anything with a hotel or restaurant could be in that system.

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 So it really is a kind of a panoptical thing.

100
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 And a real reason that we hear from the politicians is if we don't do it, Google, Apple and Facebook will do it.

101
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
 They have wallets. They have identities. They have many users.

102
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
 They could also do an identity solution.

103
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,240
 So that's the argument that the Commission is officially also putting forward why they are doing this.

104
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,240
 And lastly, you know all that we are living in the age of large language models.

105
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
 Proving to be a human will become increasingly difficult.

106
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 And that would be a way to also do that, to replace captures and prove that there is a human or someone with such an app on their phone in front of the computer.

107
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,240
 And I was hinting at this EIDAS reform, this wallet, is just one piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:57,240
 We have the European Health Data Space, which digitizes all of your interactions with your doctors, with your insurance, with your pharmacies, with your hospital,

109
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 and your medical records, prescriptions that you will take to the pharmacy will all just be attributes in the wallet.

110
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 So this will be the central key for the whole health sector.

111
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 Driver licenses will be also one other attribute.

112
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,240
 And the infamous chat control, the CESA regulation, of course heavily has an age control element, an age verification element.

113
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,240
 And as I said, EIDAS will most likely be the way to fulfill that obligation.

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,240
 As I said, we are two years into the reform. What is actually now on the tables?

115
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 For us, the biggest problem would really be to have this observable.

116
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:42,240
 To allow any central entity, an issue of this wallet, to observe our behavior, to look into all areas of life.

117
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
 So unobservability really is key. There are technical standards to do this.

118
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,240
 If you remember the QR codes that we all use in the pandemic to prove that we were vaccinated or recovered or tested,

119
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,240
 we actually managed to get strong unobservability into that law back then.

120
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:07,240
 And we are now also trying to uphold that same standard because vaccination certificates are just one of many attributes that will be part of that system.

121
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 Okay. One good news, one big problem that we saw is a unique persistent identifier, basically a serial number for humans

122
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 that would allow tracking and profiling on a completely unforeseen scale.

123
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,240
 It would be one social security number, but not just used in the health sector, but also used whenever you interact with the government,

124
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,240
 whenever you are logging into Facebook or doing a hotel booking and so forth.

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,240
 So that would really be a super cookie that follows you everywhere where you have no way of opting out.

126
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,240
 That was a big point where we fought against the commission. And I'm happy to say that by the agreement from end of June,

127
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,240
 we could actually kill the unique persistent identifier. So that's no longer in the cards.

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:09,240
 Next thing that we can strike off the list is so-called quarks. What are quarks?

129
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,240
 If you have been in the internet in 2005, 8, 9, you still remember those blue check marks in the address bar of your browser?

130
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,240
 They were called extended validation back then. They failed. All browsers decided, no, that's a horrible idea.

131
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:33,240
 We leave this aside. Now they use mandating to reintroduce those check marks for URLs for proving ownership of a website.

132
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 And they do it by obliging all browsers to include the certificates from every trust service provider in their key store for public certificates.

133
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 And what this would allow is traffic interception on a large scale. Basically, you can do man in the middle.

134
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:58,240
 You can fake ownership of Google.com, of Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Bank, from every website if you are in the root CA store of a browser.

135
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:08,240
 And that's why we pointed out this potential for huge surveillance and for interception of traffic, for undermining security.

136
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:17,240
 And I'm happy to say that we got an agreeable text in the June trial meeting. At least security is a reason to refuse certificates.

137
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,240
 Privacy sadly didn't make it into this thing. I also have to say that this is the only element, the only article of this whole reform

138
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,240
 where we had support from other actors, other NGOs like ISOC and EFF. We're solely working on that.

139
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,240
 So where Mozilla and Google and Microsoft, everyone who has a browser or who has good contacts with the big NGOs, they were working on that.

140
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,240
 And this is now concluded. But again, like for us, this is just a minor thing. We were never focused on this particular issue.

141
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:54,240
 To understand the framing that we've used and what has worked for us as an argument, we always talked about the risk of over identification.

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:04,240
 Right now, there are many things that we can do with interacting with other humans, by doing commerce, exchanging money and so forth, that we can do anonymously.

143
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 Or even if you are asked to write down your name on a piece of paper, you can give a fake name. You have a right to pseudonymity.

144
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 You could spell your name differently and that would all allow you in certain ways, keeping your privacy while interacting with others.

145
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,240
 With this system, cryptography prevents you from doing that. You don't have a reason to lie.

146
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 And over identification means that we lose, practically speaking, a lot of the anonymity that we enjoy today.

147
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:42,240
 And this risk of over identification really is vast. And we were actually supported with that from the European Data Protection Supervisor,

148
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,240
 the Datenschutzbeauftragter der EU, with his statement in February this year, where he said, like, you cannot just give this wallet into the world

149
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,240
 and then rely on consent, people saying yes or no, or if they want to share something about themselves or someone,

150
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:05,240
 you need to restrict what people are allowed to ask someone. Like, if I'm not a health provider, why would I need to know if you're vaccinated?

151
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,240
 If I'm just giving you a hotel room, why should I need your family status? So we really need to restrict the use cases.

152
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,240
 That's something that we fought for heavily and the one thing where the parliament is really not as much on our side as I would like,

153
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 because of course business interest is heavily against us. But at least we have the EDPs on our side and that is still an open fight.

154
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,240
 And what the data protection community also has to bring to the table here is we cannot rely on consent.

155
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,240
 You cannot have this OK or pay buttons that we see on news websites all over the world.

156
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:47,240
 There are so many situations where you're simply not able to say no. If it's late at night and you need to gain access to an establishment,

157
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 then you will not refuse. You will always, you can also have a border situation where it's very hard to say no if you want to enter into a country.

158
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,240
 So simply relying on consent would be very dangerous and would put the most marginalised people at risk.

159
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:15,240
 Secondly, real name policies. This debate has two sides. There are first and foremost real name policy laws that we have seen over the years nationally.

160
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:23,240
 In Germany in the mid 2000s, in Austria in 2019. It's the basic idea that oh you want to post on the internet? First give us your legal ID.

161
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:32,240
 Otherwise you're not allowed to comment, not even in a forum. And these laws usually failed because it's very expensive to identify someone.

162
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:42,240
 We are talking single or double digit euro amounts for every identification of a user. That makes many forums economically no more longer viable.

163
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 So that's why real name laws would be technically and economically feasible if this goes through.

164
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
 And this is a real risk that we cannot really address with this law individually.

165
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 But where I have, yeah, definitely there is a tectonic shift if suddenly everybody has means to identify themselves freely and cheaply vis-a-vis any private entity.

166
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:13,240
 And so what we got into the Parliament's mandate, like the text that the parliamentarians adopted, is at least that there needs to be a law.

167
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 Facebook would love to have this just in the terms of services to say oh we don't allow pseudonyms. You need to give us your legal name.

168
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:31,240
 Our advertisers would love to know that. And that would prevent at least companies from asking for identification. If there is no legal, know your customer requirements.

169
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,240
 So banks could do it, mobile providers could do it, but not just any company. Not the Schufa for example, credit scoring institutions.

170
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 Another most important thing, I mean we are talking about access to government services. That includes every single individual.

171
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:57,240
 Also the old people that are just not able or not willing to use smartphones, the privacy minded people like us here, young people that simply don't have a smartphone,

172
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 or undocumented migrants who don't have a legal residency status. This system could also marginalize many, many people.

173
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:14,240
 And the problem is that once we kill the analog processes, once there is no longer a government building where there is a person that you can talk to and you can fill out a piece of paper,

174
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,240
 if everything moves digital, it's very hard if not impossible to reintroduce an analog process.

175
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:36,240
 So if we don't save analog processes now, we might lose them forever. And so that's why one of the things that we introduced as a fail safe for real name policies and for everything here is really a non-discrimination provision.

176
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:47,240
 And I'm happy to say that the parliament adopted this in all four committees and in plenary. And what this would do is basically save us in every situation where we don't want to use this wallet.

177
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:57,240
 You could have it in your smartphone, but simply choose, "I don't trust that guy. No, I don't have the wallet." And you should not be restricted or hindered in any way.

178
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:05,240
 That's what this provision says. And it would be a right that you could also then litigate about. So if somebody infringes that, you could put them to court.

179
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 And it would be at least a fail safe for any type of discrimination from people that choose not to use this wallet.

180
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:24,240
 On the good side, I mean, there are zero-knowledge proofs in the law. What this means is that I can prove that I'm above 18 without giving my birth date, without giving anything about me.

181
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,240
 Simply I can check that I'm living in this postal code and I'm above this age. You could do any type of check in the form of a zero-knowledge proof.

182
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,240
 The parliament mandates this. Let's see whether it survives in the final law.

183
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 And because we're here at an IT security conference and a hacker conference, I also briefly want to address the huge potential for security vulnerabilities.

184
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:57,240
 I mean, this thing would be critical infrastructure. Imagine that a downtime of a day with this. You could not use public transport. You could not interact with your government.

185
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:07,240
 You might not be able to access your hotel room if you are a tourist. You will not be able to log into your bank account.

186
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,240
 So many things would not be available to people if we have this single point of failure.

187
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:25,240
 And of course, it would be a prime target for any statewide actor or criminal syndicate if you have the health, financial and identity data from half a billion of the richest people of the world in one system.

188
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:35,240
 The whole surface is huge. And just here, this is a real slide. The development that the commission for saw was like one quarter.

189
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:45,240
 Yeah. They, of course, didn't manage to keep the timetable in September. We are supposed to see the first open source implementation of the wallet.

190
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 There is a lot about the technical stuff that I'm happy to answer in Q&A. It's a disaster to put it mightily. But I mean, at least there will be an open source implementation from the commission of this wallet.

191
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 And if we succeed in Parliament, then we might also see the source code of the national wallets because every member state has to do their own wallet based on the template from the commission.

192
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,240
 And the Parliament rightfully said, no, no, no, this needs to be open source.

193
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:25,240
 Before I leave this EEDAS part and go to the other two laws that we need to talk about, I briefly want to address why there is no huge complaint from us on this issue and why we haven't simply called for rejection of this bill.

194
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:33,240
 When this law came out in June of 2021, we actually waited for half a year after our first reaction to select. Is there anyone willing to work on this?

195
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:51,240
 Nobody raised their hand. And in the second half, this first half of 2022, we actually started to work on this published papers, but we're always engaging with Adrian, the whole network of over 40 NGOs, the consumer protection organizations in Europe and also false at before in Germany.

196
00:20:51,240 --> 00:21:02,240
 Also hacker communities like the Lidlitman. Sadly, nobody of them actually wanted to work on this false at before now has it in their work program for next year when the law is done.

197
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 But that's why we couldn't do a campaign as one NGO. This is a group effort. I've done this in the past. You really need all hands on deck for that.

198
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:19,240
 And only then it can a campaign viably do a difference because you need people on the ground in the language group in order to make a difference.

199
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,240
 And why we haven't called for rejection or not only for rejection. We always said it would be a better world if we don't have that.

200
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:38,240
 But we also said like, OK, these are the safeguards that at least have to be in there if you want people to trust the system. And the real problem was also that they have this argument that we don't do this.

201
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:45,240
 Facebook and Apple will do it. And that is in Europe, a very strong driver because big tech is the devil.

202
00:21:45,240 --> 00:22:01,240
 And whenever Europe can save the people, it is very difficult to get a majority against that argument. And the Commission has used it heavily. And a rejection at this point would also be better for Europe, I think, in the short run.

203
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:10,240
 But this will pop up again and again. And at least now at this point, we still have the possibility to prevent national systems from overtaking this use case.

204
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 And many member states, the European system is a huge improvement over what people have now. And I know that in Germany this might not be the case, but I do policy for all of Europe.

205
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,240
 I cannot just orient myself on what would be best for one country.

206
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 We'll go back to Q&A about the ETHOS. But first I want to talk about printed money and cash.

207
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:41,240
 There is a law that gives us access to cash and an obligation for people to accept cash, vendors to accept cash.

208
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 This is a totally overlooked law, but I love it because it would put this stupid idea and debate to rest that we have to put the right to cash in the Constitution.

209
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,240
 You have these debates from right extremist parties all over the EU. And actually this law would more or less solve this problem.

210
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,240
 Of course, this is connected to the digital euro. You cannot have an obligation to accept the digital euro if you don't have an obligation to accept cash.

211
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 So those two are linked. What the law says, basically in a nutshell, I'm going to boil this down, is that the ability to cash in the forms of ATMs and cash county as a bank that give you out paper money,

212
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:29,240
 that needs to be available throughout the territory of a member state, also in rural areas, and member states are obliged to provide access to cash to the citizens and residents.

213
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:39,240
 And then there's also an obligation on any type of payee, a FKUF, a vendor, to not unilaterally exclude cash.

214
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,240
 So you need to accept if someone comes with a 10 euro note, in theory you should not say, "Oh no, no, I only accept a visa."

215
00:23:46,240 --> 00:24:03,240
 Of course there are exceptions to that obligation to accept cash. If it is justified and temporary, for example, if somebody comes with a 200 euro sign to pay like 3 euros, then you are able to say no, because you simply don't have enough cash at hand to give change.

216
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:12,240
 But importantly, it needs to be justified and temporary. So you could not have a blatant "no cash accepted" here sign.

217
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:21,240
 That's in the law, but we already see high commission officials to backtrack from that. So this is something where we need to be mindful to protect the right to cash.

218
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,240
 And there's also some ugly thing that the commissioner member states could add further exceptions to this obligation.

219
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:37,240
 So practically speaking, if you see any of these signs, cards only, no cash, they should be restricted if this law is adopted.

220
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,240
 And that's exactly what we are fighting for with this minor legislation that was just announced in June of this year.

221
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,240
 And yeah, summing it up, I mean there's the weak obligation, but I think we can fix that.

222
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 Enforcement is wacky and we have not enough transparency and most importantly they force all the right to complain.

223
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:11,240
 Like if you are living in a rural area and there are no ATMs anywhere around, you would have to drive 30 kilometers to get cash. You can complain, but there is no guarantee at all that you would actually get a remedy, that they would help you.

224
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:24,240
 And we would like to change that. That's it for this law. Let's talk about the digital euro. Maybe that's why you're here.

225
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,240
 So, that water was a mistake.

226
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:42,240
 So first let me say that the European Central Bank is not early with this. We have central bank money in many countries around the world in various stages.

227
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,240
 Sometimes they're just research projects, sometimes it's full-fledged digital cash available.

228
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,240
 And there are many of these maps, just Google CBCD, money, map. There are several of these maps.

229
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 And so, of course, this whole issue is kind of related to the cryptocurrency movement, Bitcoin and so forth.

230
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:09,240
 But then really it's not. The real reason why we are having this debate is because a few years ago, before the pandemic, Facebook announced that they're going to do Libra, their digital currency.

231
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,240
 And that was really a huge scare for central bankers all around the world. And that prompted many of them to move in that direction.

232
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:27,240
 Another justification that we often hear from central banks why they need to do digital money and no longer just paper money is because so much of our commerce is digital.

233
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 And believe it or not, but your bank account or your credit card, although it is in a currency, that's actually not Nordenbankgeld.

234
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,240
 It's not really currency from the central bank. It's just an obligation with Wies, an obligation with Deutsche Bank.

235
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,240
 And so that's another reason why they say we actually need to be in control of these monetary systems.

236
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:59,240
 And from a European perspective, a lot of it is also that we don't want the Visa and MasterCards and other American companies to fully control the payment system online.

237
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,240
 So there's a little bit of a digital sovereignty argument that the commission is making here as well.

238
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:21,240
 Let's boil this down, what it would mean in practice. So this digital euro, every business would have to accept it, except if they have below 10 staff and below 2 million of revenue per year.

239
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 Then if they are bigger than that, they would have to accept it. Nonprofits are also exempt.

240
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 But if any type of company or nonprofit offers digital payment, they have to offer digital euro as well.

241
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 And the commission can add further exceptions. That's a thing that we see more and more that they always give themselves the power to add something to the law later.

242
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,240
 Let's go back to this card here, to this picture of a cards only no cash sign.

243
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,240
 When we go to the digital euro, it would mean they accept cards. That means they have to accept the digital euro.

244
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 So you could have only cash sign, but any type of digital payment always has to include the digital euro.

245
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:11,240
 For us as consumers, there would be no surcharge, but the merchant might have to then incur the cost. There will be merchant fees.

246
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 How high they will be is still in dispute. Importantly, the digital euro comes in two forms, online and offline.

247
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:28,240
 And it's important to say that this is not blockchain money. This is not a decentralized ledger with any type of proof of work or proof of stake.

248
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,240
 It is a database at the ECB for the settlement of money, every digital money they give out.

249
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,240
 But it's a centralized database and it will basically include all of the holdings of any type of digital euro anywhere.

250
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:51,240
 That's at least true when it comes to online payments. There's also an offline version, which is really horrible.

251
00:28:51,240 --> 00:29:02,240
 The commission was actually doing a survey, a big consultation with business and NGOs, inquiring what would be important if we do a digital euro.

252
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:10,240
 Unilaterally, everybody said privacy is the most important thing, even the business sector. And that's the one thing where they fucked up completely.

253
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 So you are fully identified when you as a person or as a company interact with your bank or the PayPal with any type of payment service provider,

254
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:28,240
 because all of these payment service providers are obliged to offer the digital euro, potentially also crypto exchanges, by the way.

255
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:38,240
 And they would have a unique identifier, persistent identifier that identifies you, an identifier for your device if you use the offline euro and your transaction history.

256
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:49,240
 And the bank would know that. And then everything on the right side, the European Central Bank, the national central banks, their settlement infrastructure,

257
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,240
 the Ani-Money Laundering Institute, financial intelligence units, like all of the people that do anti-terror financing,

258
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,240
 and then some form of providers of support services that are completely left blank, what they would do.

259
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,240
 All of them would have access to your transaction history and your pseudomized data. So they wouldn't know your real name.

260
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:20,240
 But in effect, they could really easily identify yourself. Because if I know what your employer is, if I know where you live and with whom you are paying your rent,

261
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,240
 it would be very easy to actually re-identify people. And in case of money laundering or fraud, they could easily re-identify.

262
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:35,240
 If your bank goes bankrupt and you have to switch your accounts, they could re-identify. So one central banker put it like this,

263
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:44,240
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could sue everything, but we promise not to look." So it's really a disastrous architecture when it comes to privacy.

264
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 And that's just only the online part. For the offline part, we have a little bit higher privacy incentives,

265
00:30:51,240 --> 00:31:02,240
 because you would still have the ECB with the settlement infrastructure knowing that you on your device with this identifier have,

266
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,240
 let's say, 50 digital euros for offline payments stored. And then when you exchange that money to someone else,

267
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,240
 the transaction individually would not be noted centrally. So there wouldn't be a record how you spend your money.

268
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,240
 But then, of course, if the other person in their wallet wants to convert that offline euro money back into anything else,

269
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:33,240
 they would have then again the funding and defunding of these transactions. So that, of course, is a very weak form of privacy to begin with.

270
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:43,240
 And it very much depends on the proliferation of that whole system. And if you have any interest or listened or read up on how digital money works,

271
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,240
 you might be aware of the problem of double spending. Computers copy stuff all the time, perfect copies of everything.

272
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:59,240
 How do you prevent digital money from being copied twice so that you can use the same five euros and spend it twice or three times or a few million times?

273
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:08,240
 Blockchains and Bitcoin solve this by decentralized ledger. Here we only have a centralized ledger.

274
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:18,240
 Offline payment means there is no network. And the only thing they rely upon are the secure enclaves on our phones.

275
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:28,240
 And then if you read up in Article 30, they actually say, "Final settlement of online offline digital euro payment transactions

276
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,240
 shall occur at the moment when the records of the digital euro holdings concerned in the local stirvichas of the payer and payee are updated."

277
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 So, legally speaking, you can copy money if there ever is a vulnerability in the secure enclaves.

278
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:51,240
 And if you've read the recent book of Cory Doctorow, Red Team Blues, it's a whole novel about what can go wrong with that.

279
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:00,240
 I mean, secure enclaves are secure for the most part, but you basically trust them completely to the vendors of these devices and these security chips.

280
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,240
 And I, as someone who has some interest in the euro not falling apart tomorrow, I'm really worried about this provision.

281
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:14,240
 Because, I mean, this would be an attack surface that would be very, very lucrative for criminals.

282
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:21,240
 And we're not even talking about Russia or any other state-level actor that might want to fuck with the European Central Bank

283
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,240
 and destabilize the biggest market in the world with the euro.

284
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,240
 So, summing it up, I mean, the digital euro bill honestly has no benefits for the user.

285
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,240
 We couldn't find anything that would make a good case for us as citizens or consumers why we should use that.

286
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,240
 It's horrible in privacy. It's blind trust in secure elements and banks and the central banks.

287
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,240
 And the potential for control and surveillance is just insurmountable and completely disproportionate.

288
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 And so I think, actually, that there is a good chance that this could be killed.

289
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 It's still early stages, as I said, the law came out in June.

290
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,240
 We will publish an analysis in the next months, but it's still in drafting stage and review stage.

291
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,240
 And I want to have other NGOs on board with this as well.

292
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 But that's where we stand with the digital euro.

293
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,240
 And lastly, I want to just briefly zoom a little bit out.

294
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
 We have similarities between these reforms.

295
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:24,240
 I mean, the digital identity and the digital euro both have privacy safeguards only in theory, not in the law.

296
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,240
 So we need to really increase the law if this should be good at all in any way.

297
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,240
 Both laws leave the technical implementation and feasibility unclear.

298
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,240
 Like both of the wallet and with the digital euro, it's kind of unclear if this would ever work.

299
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
 Oh, and I haven't even told you the best bit.

300
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,240
 The European Central Bank decided, so I mean, we are printing the money.

301
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,240
 We just let eight and twelve different companies develop the digital euro in parallel.

302
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 And then we just pick the best implementation that we like the most.

303
00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 And one of the companies, Rumors has it, that is tended out by the European Central Bank to develop the central euro is Amazon.

304
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,240
 As I said, like both proposals allow a bird's eye view upon an optical about all areas of our lives.

305
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,240
 And it's a cheap excuse for the EU to say big tech would be worse.

306
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
 Big tech would do this. So we have to do it first.

307
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,240
 But that's the underlying argument with both of these reforms.

308
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
 And this basically concludes the talk.

309
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 We still have ten minutes for Q&A.

310
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,240
 Before we go to that, just say that we'll have another session here in this tent tomorrow at 11 p.m.

311
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:42,240
 because we give data access to everyone here at camp to a tool that we are developing to contact members of the European Parliament.

312
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,240
 So it's something that we'll use for chat control first, but it will be free software and a GPL license.

313
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
 It's a way to contact parliamentarians quite easily.

314
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,240
 And everybody is invited to join the demo and to come tomorrow to talk with us.

315
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
 Yeah, that's that. I'm looking forward to your questions.

316
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:13,240
 Thank you very much for the wonderful talk.

317
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,240
 We have some questions. I would start with the Internet. So signal Asian.

318
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:36,240
 The Internet is asking, does the use of the secure enclave for offline transaction with the digital euro mean everyone who uses an open source operating system on their phone will be excluded from the digital euro?

319
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,240
 That could very well be the case, yes.

320
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:46,240
 And that that might also be an exclusionary factor for the European digital identity wallet as well.

321
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,240
 And it gets even worse because according to some versions of the law, biometrics could be another precondition.

322
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,240
 So you need to have a big tech phone and you need to enable biometrics.

323
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240
 And that, of course, would be absolutely horrible.

324
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,240
 And but those are conditions that the EU is seriously putting in a lot.

325
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:22,240
 So then thanks for the talk. I have a very simple question. What happens to a person who has two citizenships or more for the digital identity?

326
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,240
 That's a good question. So there should be interoperability between the European digital identity wallets.

327
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:35,240
 So you could have Swedish and Belgium digital identity wallet or you could have your Swedish identity and the Belgian wallet.

328
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,240
 There should be full interoperability within these systems.

329
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,240
 Mind you, that data portability is restricted to technical feasibility.

330
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,240
 So an open source wallet again might be something that we still have to fight about.

331
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,240
 But the government issued wallets should be interoperable.

332
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,240
 I think the mic is over there.

333
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,240
 I would have a rather technical question about the implementation of the EUD digital wallet.

334
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:18,240
 If I'm not mistaken, the reference framework includes adherence as a must to the V3C VC standard, which is basically the V3C standard for blockchain implementations.

335
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:30,240
 Do you see any way of getting that argued out given that they already are putting up a reference open source implementation that has a mandatory blockchain standard inside, which is kind of a Trojan horse?

336
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:41,240
 Yeah, absolutely right. And I actually haven't included that there is a project called DC3, a huge multimillion large scale pilot for EEDAS,

337
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:53,240
 which basically has all of the Social Security insurances from EU member states proving on a blockchain if a person is health insured or not.

338
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 And that's just one of the examples where a lot of money and development cost has gone in there. You're right in the RAF and the architecture reference framework.

339
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,240
 We similarly have these Trojan horses.

340
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,240
 There is a whole consortium for European blockchain that heavily influences all of these projects.

341
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,240
 And two weeks ago we had the kickoff workshop from the German ministries on the EEDAS implementation.

342
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,240
 And they were very proudly saying, we decided in Germany that we'll not use blockchain.

343
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,240
 And I pointed out to them that's actually not really helpful if the EU mandates blockchain.

344
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
 So that cognitive dissonance has not really sink in, I believe.

345
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,240
 And yeah, the problem is that this will be decided on the European level.

346
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,240
 And as I just said, these wallets and the attributes will be interoperable.

347
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,240
 So we cannot just save this for Germany, neither what I think that we should.

348
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,240
 OK, more questions?

349
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,240
 Maybe just over there and then audience again.

350
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
 Just one piece of information that may be useful.

351
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:12,240
 I believe this lady, Elaine Barker, who's the one who ran the NSA's program to backdoor to have these the dual EC DRBG backdoor distributed.

352
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,240
 She is, I think, now the head of cryptography at Amazon.

353
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,240
 Interesting. Thank you.

354
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:32,240
 Thank you very much for your work.

355
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:42,240
 I was offline wallet is each euro each cent is it like unique or is it just like a mount which are being transferred?

356
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
 Is it or is it not decided yet?

357
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,240
 So actually digital euro is fungible.

358
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:59,240
 So it clearly says like with cash that any 10 euro note, any digital 10 euro should be absolutely the same and interchangeable.

359
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,240
 Whether that's true in the technical implementation is very much in dispute.

360
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,240
 Like whether there is no unique identifier attached to digital euro.

361
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,240
 The law doesn't say anything about that.

362
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:27,240
 And that would be one of many things where the law needs to specify that the technical implementation has to prevent any type of profiling, tracking of individual euro, digital euro coins.

363
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,240
 But so far the law is silent on that question.

364
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:38,240
 You mentioned that it's like the same as a euro banknote, but a banknote is I mean, it has a serial.

365
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:51,240
 You're right. And I mean, they might argue it in the same way that you but legally speaking, you cannot say I am a matter is to euro 50.

366
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:59,240
 But I only accept banknotes with serial numbers ending in an odd digit, you know, that that is what they mean with fungibility.

367
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
 But you're absolutely right.

368
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:14,240
 The only money laundering people could then say, no, but we need to be able to track everything and that that will be a huge fight because money laundering legislation already is horrible when it comes to privacy.

369
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,240
 That's the reason why having any type of payment service provider that's privacy friendly is super hard.

370
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,240
 And we we cannot rewrite anti money laundering law with digital euro.

371
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:35,240
 Sadly.

372
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:46,240
 So I think with anti money laundering laws, there's often the discussion to restrict payments and over a certain sum, it should be a digital payment.

373
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
 Right.

374
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:57,240
 Could you see that also as a possible implementation of the digital euro that, for example, the offline wallet only could contain, say, ten thousand euros.

375
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,240
 So to prevent the or as an attempt to prevent money laundering.

376
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,240
 Yes, that's already in the draft bill on several ways.

377
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,240
 So you can have a spending limit or a holding limit on digital euros.

378
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:19,240
 You will also have a cap on the amount of online digital euros that you can have. And the real reason for them, of course, is anti money laundering.

379
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:34,240
 But then it's also because the banks are super pissed at you because if you have ten thousand euros in your bank account with Deutsche Bank, it's actually money that they hold and that they can give out as credits to someone else where they get interest.

380
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,240
 If you have the same ten thousand euros in your digital euro account, it's actually not money that the bank can use in any way.

381
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,240
 Yeah. And so it's much more like the money you have on your pillow.

382
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:55,240
 And that's why the banking industry actually is super pissed at you about doing this with the digital euro, which might be a potential ally for us to work with.

383
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,240
 So you already mentioned that that factor of the trust execution environment.

384
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,240
 What other considerations does the policy have for the security of this money?

385
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:12,240
 Because there's not really any guarantee that the device the app is running on is actually a trusted device.

386
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
 User is an attacker.

387
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:21,240
 The answer to that question, like with all of these bills, also in the digital euro, is certification.

388
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
 There will be a certification that it is secure.

389
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,240
 Because when it has that stamp, we blindly believe it.

390
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,240
 Sadly, that's the only thing in the digital euro bill when it comes to that.

391
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,240
 You would expect that there is provisions about what's that in English?

392
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,240
 Haftung, like who bears the risk and who would be liable.

393
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,240
 Yeah. And and so there is no merchant liability in case of a double spend, for example.

394
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,240
 The law is lacking provisions like that totally.

395
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,240
 There was a talk on Nutala here on this stage, I think yesterday or the day before.

396
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,240
 It must have been yesterday.

397
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,240
 Are there any ideas from Nutala or any other similar projects that the digital euro might borrow?

398
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,240
 Or do these projects already or ideas from the projects already the political debate?

399
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,240
 Yeah, I mean, Marie put me up to this talk basically.

400
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,240
 So Marie from Blackwater 2 is working for Tala and she said it would be good to complement the tech side with the legal side.

401
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
 This one here.

402
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,240
 I hope that these discussions are happening and I think that Tala has at least with their Swiss established organization.

403
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
 With the Swiss they are talking a lot.

404
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,240
 I don't know how much they are in exchange with the European Central Bank, particularly on the offline thing.

405
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:56,240
 I heard that those arguments were made to the ECB and the Commission, but it was a political decision to still move ahead and to have to online and offline systems.

406
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
 Although the offline one clearly includes certain risks.

407
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:06,240
 What I can say is speaking for the Tala team, we had several rounds of discussion with the European Central Bank.

408
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:17,240
 They are very well aware of Tala, but I think the short answer is they prefer the absolute control over the population over adding privacy and listening to technical advice.

409
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:23,240
 With the exception of the Austrian Central Bank that wrote a paper that Tala would be the best solution for the digital euro.

410
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,240
 But it's just one of the member states central banks.

411
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,240
 But they are at least aware and we have talked to several member states central banks and the European Central Bank.

412
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,240
 So they have no excuse of saying we didn't know.

413
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:46,240
 Are there further questions? Please raise your hand.

414
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:58,240
 What are some practical and useful things that everyone here could do to stop the legislation?

415
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:07,240
 I mean, with the digital euro, we are thankfully very early on and the earlier you engage in your debates, the better, the more efficient it is.

416
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:12,240
 So really combining in every we have a single group.

417
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:23,240
 If you come later, then I'm happy to put on your contacts and have the NGOs that at least have shown initial interest in this file to it would always be helpful.

418
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:34,240
 If the people working on legal also have support from the tech community and particularly people that work on practical implementations, you know, because we need to make those arguments.

419
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,240
 And first and foremost, what is your euro? It's still time to organize.

420
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:52,240
 As I said, like there will be a legal assessment so that we at least to our side that there is a whole picture of like what is what is wrong and what would work, what wouldn't review from a technical side for that paper would also be welcome.

421
00:47:52,240 --> 00:48:04,240
 And then subsequently, it's the long and winding road with speaking with MEPs, with local governments, maybe also speaking with central banks and forming alliances.

422
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:12,240
 I think particularly on this issue, there are interesting coalitions that would maybe really allow us to kill the digital euro.

423
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:21,240
 But we need to always do this with unlikely allies. And I mean, encryption in the nineties, we also killed with the banks together, so it wouldn't be unprecedented.

424
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:28,240
 So that the short answer is organized. And that's also why we're here on the E does file.

425
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:39,240
 We are so late in the debate that only like what we are doing is basically holding the hands of the negotiators and trying to influence the draft as much as possible.

426
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:51,240
 Trial is a nightmare. You got 60 pages at 10 p.m. and you have until 8 a.m. to give a response. But that is something where we are trying to stay on top with that file.

427
00:48:51,240 --> 00:49:03,240
 And there are individual member states where it would make sense to push anyone being in Spain, working on Spain, who could help get the government little bit more on our side.

428
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:16,240
 The presidency holds the keys here. They are the one country that can propose new language. And yeah, but these things, once they're in trial, it's inherently secretive in the parliament.

429
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:23,240
 Everything is public and look at every amendment. You know, every deadline, you know, when they meet, you can watch the live stream in trial.

430
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:37,240
 Look, everything is limited secret. It's like even if you get the text, you're not even allowed to share. That's why he does is at this stage at best we can hope to get what we have already in the parliament's mandate.

431
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:46,240
 And honestly, that would build be a huge improvement. Will I rest easy with the E does that it is not a law that will horribly regret?

432
00:49:46,240 --> 00:50:04,240
 Probably no. But I've just again, we are one NGO. We tried our best to unfuck it as much as possible. Okay. Those are my questions open. No. Okay. I think then we know there's.

433
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:18,240
 Oh, there's. Um, it is at the works. We are based in Vienna. We are 12 people. This rights NGO founded 14 years ago as working group on data retention.

434
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:29,240
 We were the ones that killed the data retention surveillance bill in 2014. We worked a lot on net neutrality and digital identity has been a major issue since 2017 for us.

435
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:41,240
 And a lot of covert legislation in the pandemic. And yeah, we basically are one of these small fast chips that goes where it hurts where we can make a difference.

436
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:48,240
 And we are part of a tree, the European umbrella network of over 40 to rights NGOs.

437
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,240
 And we live off donations.

438
00:50:52,240 --> 00:51:04,240
 Okay. If there are no questions left, I would say you can deepen your talks, your topics with Thomas. Maybe we have dinner time right now. So maybe you can catch him up.

439
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:22,240
 Thank you a lot. Thank you, Thomas, for this wonderful talk. I think we give him a big applause again.

440
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,240
 Thank you.
