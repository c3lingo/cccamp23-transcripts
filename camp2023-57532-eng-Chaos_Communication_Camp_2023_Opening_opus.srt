 [BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It's wonderful to see you here.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Welcome to the Chaos Communication Camp 2023.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 [APPLAUSE]

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We're so happy to see you here at the first CCC event after three and a half years.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 There are some differences to the last camps and events.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 For example, we see there are much more people here, we are 6,000 people.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [APPLAUSE]

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We have the new concept of decentralized stages.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Here is the Markba stage, we also have, and the other stages are organized from the villages.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We have the food stalls, you can see them behind of you.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And we know it's still wonderful and we would like to have a wonderful camp.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 [APPLAUSE]

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Some fun fact, the 36C3 is 1,325 days ago.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Please check if I'm right, maybe I'm wrong.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And we know, talk to other people, that's why we are here in Brandenburg.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And have a nice time.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 [APPLAUSE]

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yeah, as some of you may have noticed, we have a wonderful design with great arts and logos.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 For example, if you can see it on the screens, there is FISTI.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 FISTI is an interesting symbol and I think it represents our community very nice.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Because it uses the symbol of the raised fist.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And this means we should be strong together, we are a community.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I think this is very, very important for us.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And I think it's a very good match for this community and for this event.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because we have some core values and I want to remember them.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We have, for example, the UnvereinbarkeitserklÃ¤rung.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I think this is only available in German.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 But I wanted to cite some sentences from it.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Because I think it's very important that you all know that this belongs to our core values.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But those who approach us with ideas of racism, exclusion and the structural and physical violence associated with it.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Have abandoned dialogue and are beyond the limits of acceptance.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 In addition to that, we have another important thing, the hacker ethics.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 If you break stuff, build new stuff, try to remember.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Look in the hacker ethics because there are some good advices what you can do and what you shouldn't do.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 When we were asked to do this opening, we thought about what the DCC makes for us and why we even go to DCWEN.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 It's an interesting question and we thought about the core values.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We also think the DCC as a civilian organization is wonderful and it shouldn't be different.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Also, there are people here we can trust that understand us.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And also that just like I think we all know that there are differences between the outside world and here.

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Like we are an invalid organization.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 We can just be here.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We are like-minded.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 We understand each other and we can have a wonderful time together.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 [Applause]

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And I have a question.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Which people of you are here for the first time?

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I want to see who is new to the camp.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Oh, that's a lot.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Yeah, that are a few people.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Thank you for coming here.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 [Applause]

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And for you people and for the other ones who were here a long time ago,

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 I have some things which we should remember because they are very important to survive this great event.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And a run rule we have is sleep, eat, shower and repeat daily.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 At least six times a day sleep.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 At least two times a day food.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And at least one time a day shower.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And also sleep in addition at least six hours.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 That's probably the sixth.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah, and that's very important that you can stay safe and enjoy the wonderful event.

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 We don't want in the infrastructure we will be on the last day.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 We don't want the third to say that there are like many people with injuries of any kind.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And we want to stay healthy, we want you to stay healthy and otherwise we will probably be broke.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 In addition to that sunburn is a thing.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Also when the sun is not visible, you need sun protection.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I tried that also two days ago.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I thought I don't need that and I need it.

73
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Yeah, I also can learn things.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Also if you feel like the sun is burning you, you can also apply the sun protection multiple times a day

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and think of it, remind your other hackers around you and care for all of you.

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Another important rule is that you drink enough water because drinking not enough water is a common DDoS attack at chaos events.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So please there is water overall, there are water dispensers to refill your bottles.

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Please use them, drink enough water because the sun is hot.

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And if we have dehydrated people, they can't enjoy the event anymore.

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So please, please drink enough water that you can stay hydrated.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 For those of you who are not here for the first time, you probably know the sentence "all creatures welcome".

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It's one of the guidelines of CCC and the events for a long time, at least for the full time I was on these events.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I think it's wonderful.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's also Snoopy said about the core values and they refer to that.

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 There's also in the statue of the Chaos Computer Club is this wonderful sentence,

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 "The Chaos Communication Club is a galactic community of living beings independent of age, gender, ancestry or social status."

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I think we all should remember that.

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 We are different and that's wonderful.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Everybody should feel welcome here, should express themselves.

90
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And have also like we are different people sometimes and we can be what we want here.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And at least I love that.

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Also for that, we should make this campus accessible for people with disabilities of any kind.

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 If you are a village and have these large white tents from the Orga, there are still some ramps for wheelchairs.

94
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And you can call the village Orga, the village team and they will get them to you.

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Another thing in the history of CCC events, you all probably know, the X-Leading to each other.

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 We extended this a little bit, the X-Leading to each other and also to yourself.

97
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Like mental health is a thing and please care for you and all the other people around you.

98
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 If you don't feel comfortable or in any kind, it's mental or physical, you can go to help.ccc.de.

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And there are teams on site which will help you like Assert and awareness and other teams.

100
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 You can call them on deck and if you don't have a deck, ask other people, they will be happy to help you.

101
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Another thing, this event is only possible because we have much volunteers there

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 and those volunteers helped a long time to make this great event possible and they are called angels.

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 They have everywhere, you may have seen them already at the entrances, they are at the cash desk,

104
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 they are at the heaven and coordinating other angels, they are all running around and they help to refill bars.

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Without these angels, this camp would not be possible, so thank you for all the angels who are already here and helping for the build up.

106
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 That these angels are helping so much is very great, but I want to remember them and all of us,

107
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 we shouldn't work too hard if we need a break, we should take a break because if we work too hard for this event,

108
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I think it's not good because we are getting issues from that.

109
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I heard from the other angels and this would be nice if they make a break,

110
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 that they get food and can help make this event better when they are healthy and can help.

111
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 One other thing, if you are wondering about the angels and the heaven and want to help make this event great,

112
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 you can go to the heaven, it is there in one of the tents, there is a large sign with heaven above it,

113
00:12:42,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and you can just ask them what to do and they will explain everything you need to know that you can help to make this event great.

114
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 One part of what we expect from each other is about photos.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We want to have photos of the event, we want to publish them, but you should and need to ask all the people in the picture

116
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 before taking photos if it's okay for them to be on the photo.

117
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 There are people here who don't want to be on the internet or have a photo of them on the internet and we want to respect that.

118
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 [Applause]

119
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Okay, and now we have a number of dangerous hazards, tents and lines of the tents and cables and rails.

120
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 They are all over the place. You may have seen the trailer and I heard from people who had issues with the tracks

121
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 because in the dark you can't see them, please bring light, be careful when you're walking around.

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 For the tents, there are some tails somewhere I've seen them which is bright, you can put it on the lines that you use for your tents

123
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 so people also in the dark can see them and don't stumble over them because it can be very dangerous.

124
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Also, if you have vehicles, there are a few around here, I've seen some body cars and bikes and maybe cars.

125
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 If it's night and dark outside, please use lights because it's very important they are moving

126
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 and if you can't be seen and can't see anything, this is also dangerous and yeah, this is very important.

127
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And if you drive, please drive with walking speed because there are many people here

128
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and we don't want that you crash into other people.

129
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Again, we want you to stay healthy.

130
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 [Applause]

131
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 You may have seen already this blue, we call them the art and clothes.

132
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 There are not toilets even if they look like they are, there are network housings,

133
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 well, housings for network equipment and please don't use them as a toilet.

134
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 It already happened during build up.

135
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 I think this should remind all of us that it can happen but it shouldn't and it's a huge mess for the people who need to clean this up.

136
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And we don't want to have them in this mess.

137
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So before I'm going to talk about some highlights, I want to say another important thing.

138
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I've heard that some people are already tagging the area with graffiti.

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Please don't do that. Please remember we are in a museum and have some old stuff here

140
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 which is very important for the Siege of Leipzig Park and please don't tag them.

141
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 They are old, they are valuable and please respect them because we want to have them that we can do some art with it.

142
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Okay, for the highlights we have a batch.

143
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 This is traditional on KS Communication camps.

144
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Some of you may remember the last time there was the radio, some have them.

145
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I've seen some on the site and this time we have the flower.

146
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's here. It's something like a synthesizer. It makes sounds, it makes lights.

147
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So if you walk there beforehand and pre-sale, you can get them at a special tent.

148
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I'm not sure which one I'm using so I didn't ask for information. It's somewhere out there but it's going to be very useful.

149
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So you can experiment with the batch. There's something you might have to do with it.

150
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Just find out what people are going to do with it and extend it, tag it, have fun.

151
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 [Applause]

152
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 We asked the art team before we wanted to present some highlights and take art highlights and we asked them and they asked us what the other projects are and we thought we could mention all of them.

153
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 So I think we can say that the campgrounds, find out what they are and the other ones.

154
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 [Applause]

155
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 One of the highlights I've already seen is the train. You may have noticed already the train tracks are all over the place.

156
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I think it's a great opportunity to see the campground from outside if you would like to see the train.

157

 Some clubs and lounges. You can look for them at the schedule. It's published yesterday. There are some wonderful acts that we think or that we not thought that we would get them. So please look at the schedule and find out what happens and have fun there.

 [Applause]

160
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And at last we want to wish you a wonderful adventure. Have fun. Experience the camp. Just have a wonderful time for a few days. Sorry.

00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 [Applause]

162
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Yeah, and there is one last thing. A few of you remembered maybe Andrei Yanitsevsky, also known as Tepsky. If you look on the screens we found a picture for him and we think he would be very happy and proud of us if we are having fun.

163
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I see a lot of people who think we are doing great things here and I think he would like that.

164
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And we also think it would be great if we can cheer together on Andrei and the camp and we have some small drinks for you prepared.

165
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 We have non-alcoholic ones. The non-alcoholic ones are apple juice. They are yellow. And the other ones are clear. This is alcohol. So please open the crates.

166
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Take one, come to the crates and we should cheer all together.

 Okay, I think most of you have the drinks. Are you ready? In memory to Tepsky and for a wonderful CCC camp. Cheers!
