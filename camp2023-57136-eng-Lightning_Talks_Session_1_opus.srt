4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Okay, dann herzlich willkommen meine Daseinsformen und Menschen. Zum Glück ist nicht mehr ganz so heiß, sonst würde ich hier auf dieser Bühne wahrscheinlich ziemlich schnell verschmoren.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Willkommen zu Lightning Talks. Willkommen zu Lightning Talks, ladies and gentlemen. Who in this audience does not speak German?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Okay, that's a lot of people, so I will try to speak in English.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Basically, I think you might all know what this is all about. Lightning Talks. Anyone can come up to the stage, just talk about anything.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Any topic is allowed if it's not just political propaganda or something.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You have 10 minutes, then we will switch. We have a laptop, you can plug in your USB stick and display your PDF slides.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 We have also Ethernet, so you can just call up the slides on your browser.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Yeah, we have a microphone. I had a list of people who want to have talks, but I have it on my other hard drive and the other hard drive is not here.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So, who wanted to hold a talk?

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Alright. I wrote to you if you're number one or two or three on the list.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Yes. You want to come first? Okay. We have lots of time. We only have four people who came here in advance, so just come up and say something.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Another thing, you might see that the slides are not very well visible, but we have apparently on Media CCCDE there is a stream with slides only.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So, you can select the stream on your own device and have a little cheat sheet on your smartphone if you can't really see the slides.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Okay. That was the talk about BaseBanana. Then welcome!

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 [Applause]

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Here's the mouse.

 [Background noise]

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Hello? Okay. It's working.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Hello. I'm Mitek. I speak about BaseBanana. That is my project. Stupid and funny project.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 This project was talked for Italian language, so I don't know if it works fine in English or in German or in other languages, but I'm sure that in Italian it works fine.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 It's banana fruit, but it's also a kind of word. A kind of word means that in the 90s when I was young I got this book from an Italian author that was speaking on play on words.

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 My favorite chapter was called Banana, Ananas, Avocado, and Ribes. Ananas is a pineapple in English, and ribes is a carrot.

28
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The concept was that banana is a word that is formed by consonant and vowel, consonant and vowel, and so on.

29
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And so ananas is the same, but starting with a vowel and ending with a consonant. Avocado is the same with both vowels and so on.

30
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 You can find a lot of words in Italian that are using this schema. In English it's more difficult, but I have some examples. Locate, legitimate, manage, moderate, negative, and so on.

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I used ananas to create a random word that doesn't mean nothing, but can be spelled easy and can be also remembered well.

32
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I used it for creating passwords because it was easy to remember, but it's very weak. I have also a service that is a URL shortener that is called vado.ly.

33
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 When you create the shortener, the random code is a banana word. It's easy also to speak on the phone and say go to this address, and it's easier than other strange codes with numbers and capital letters and so on.

34
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So, yeah, it's sometimes useful.

35
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Then I got in touch with Libre Mesh. Libre Mesh is a project about mesh networking, and it's a firmware to allow some routers to make mesh networks.

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 When you flash the firmware the first time, the name of the router is Lime and six digits of MAC address. This is done because you can create a random name, because if you flash it again it changes name.

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It takes the last six charters from the MAC address, but it's difficult to remember and it's impossible to pronounce Lime 3, 4, 8, 9, F2. It's difficult.

38
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I thought why not to convert this code in a banana? For example, Lime double-alo. It's easier to pronounce and also to remember. Make sense?

39
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Yeah, okay. How I did it? When you have a basis, you have alphabets with symbols. For example, binary you have 0 and 1. For decimal you have from 0 to 9.

40
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Base64 has 64 symbols. BaseBanana has two alphabets, one for consonant and one for vowels. When you are calculating you're taking consonant and vowel, consonant and vowel.

41
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's not the whole alphabet because in Italian we don't have some letters. For example, X, W are not used in Italian. Also, H and Q need U after that. It was difficult to create a word that sounds good.

42
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Now we can start to count. It's difficult to see, but starting from 0, you have the first consonant is B and the first vowel is A. So 0 is BA.

43
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Then you have BA, B, BA, BOO with the vowels. Then you switch to C. You go on until ZU is 69. The next number is BA.

44
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You add two letters and you can count in BaseBanana. We have an example. I think it's not visible, but starting from 1, there are some examples.

45
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 When you add a word that is BA, you arrive to 1 million that is "per ame puga". In some way I can remember it.

46
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 There are different columns because if the banana word is short, you can add leading zeros. Like you add leading zeros in X, you can add BA that is 0.

47
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 B is the same as BABE. BABE is always the same number.

48
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 We are quite finished. I wrote a Python script that is also a library. You have different functions. You can encode, decode, generate random banana numbers and also check if it's a banana.

49
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You can change the alphabet. You can change the alphabet of the letter you prefer. You also have more than two alphabets.

50
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You can have three or four alphabets. It's difficult to see on the screen, but I use the Unicode and I have an alphabet made with animals and one with balls and one with fruit.

51
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I can encode using this alphabet and also the number can be decoded using the same alphabet.

52
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I did porting of the Python library. It's not complete porting. Only a few lines of code.

53
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But I did it in JavaScript, Lua, PHP and Shell script. So if you want to test it or you want to improve it, you are free to do it.

54
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Yesterday I had an engine shift in BGP that is for shipping packets.

55
00:11:36,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 The tracking code is a six digit hex. I thought why instead of having code 3C, 5B, 4, 5, you can use DENIFINA. It's easier to search something with a word that sounds and you can remember the sound for three seconds.

56
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 So it would be if you are presenting this project, it would be a good idea to include in your project. It can be useful for your projects to include the Banana library.

57
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And I finished. Thanks to everyone. You can find the documentation, the code on GitHub and on the main site.

58
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And you can write a mail or call me using that. Thank you.

59
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Thank you very much. You should have brought a real banana and encode into the banana.

60
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I have a banana with stickers on it.

61
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 We need more stickers. Does the stream version work with the slides? Can you guys see it? Nothing at all?

62
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Question? What's his deck number in banana?

63
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I don't know. Let me see. Firefox, if you go to base banana.

64
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 On the website you can see the demo page and you can find 4832 with no minimum length.

65
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Zuby is 4832. It's easy on the website because there is a script running that can encode the code with the standard alphabet.

66
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Perfect. Thank you.

67
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I see the next speaker is already up. Come here. Welcome.

68
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I knew my number.

69
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Do you need a browser?

70
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Free the wrist.

71
00:14:43,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And you have a mouse too.

72
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Perfect.

73
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And you have a microphone. Does the microphone work? Yes, it works.

74
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Ten minutes.

75
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Hello everyone. I would like to say something about my tiny project which is called "Sorry Odro".

76
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I'm Rotroth. My deck phone number is 4560. No idea how it will be in banana alphabet but I'll learn any time soon.

77
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 A very brief disclaimer. I'm a computer scientist. I'm not a biologist or ecologist.

78
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Whatever is ecologically or biologically wrong here, that's my fault because I know zeros and ones.

79
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I would like to say something about a river. A river that is basically linking three countries.

80
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Czech Republic, Czechia, Poland and Germany. And apparently most likely some of you know which river I have in mind.

81
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Do you?

82
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Odra.

83
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And the Odra River starts in Czechia. Kozlov. It's 866 kilometers long.

84
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And flows through Poland and then becomes a natural border between Poland and Germany.

85
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It also forms an inland sea where it ends and goes to Ostse and Moze Bautickie afterwards.

86
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So it's a pretty long river, pretty wide river. Luckily it's not used anymore as an inland waterway.

87
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It's regulated throughout the last 200 centuries but given near to zero water traffic it is fun to explore it.

88
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And I did it some time back taking 600 kilometers out of it. So the majority of it.

89
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Unfortunately given how well the pictures are seen you won't see a very nice portfolio of pictures from the Odra River.

90
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So believe me or these who can see them on the slides I hope they'll appreciate.

91
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Anyway, let me slowly move to the merits of the presentation.

92
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Yeah, there is the stork on the lamp.

93
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Some birds, some green areas, some river, more birds.

94
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And if some of you are still willing to camp more after the camp you can go there and have a really nice enjoyable trip by, I don't know, kayak, inflatable boat whatsoever.

95
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Anyway, I've got a number of fun facts about Odra. And these fun facts relate to Poland specifically because that's what I observed when I studied the whole problem.

96
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So as of November 2022 there were 751 water permits to dump sewage into Odra River and its tribuaries in place, meaning nearly 800 of institutions threw sewage into the river.

97
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 But, but, and it's very important, only one permit application has been rejected ever, meaning we see some progress.

98
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 One of 752 has been rejected.

99
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Unfortunately the environmental impact is not taken into account when deciding upon these permits.

100
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So it's only a technical procedure to get the permit issued and you're good to go.

101
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And some cities, majority of cities dump sewage, water from mines, rain waters, manufacturer companies, power plants, they do it all together and dump all that into the river.

102
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Anyway, when you swim it you don't feel it. I mean there is a huge disconnection between how you feel when going through the river and what's being dumped into the river.

103
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And most importantly after the permit has been issued no on-site verification is taking place, meaning they don't verify whether you actually dumped what you promised to dump.

104
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So why not to overuse it, let me put it that way.

105
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And for the ones that like numbers I've got some, they are pretty outdated, but from 2012 there was a study that proved that

106
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Morze Bałtyckie or how Germans call it Ostse has been provided with 19 tons of zinc, 56 tons of copper, 7.5 tons of lead and 26 tons of nickel.

107
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And that's official, that's what Polish government admitted.

108
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And my feeling is that most likely the situation did not get better since 2012.

109
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 There is the water quality index which basically says that water in the Odra River is 4 or 5 out of 5 levels and as you may guess the best quality is 1.

110
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 So we are at the very bottom here and that's basically the reason why I'm here.

111
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Okay, some of you might have heard about the 2022 other environmental disaster. Basically a mass mortality last year occurred in the Odra River.

112
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That involved fish, beavers, crayfish and other wildlife. Tons of these, I'm not here to show you the pictures, I don't like to see these pictures at all.

113
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Nevertheless the root causes are not known, but surely the following conditions contributed.

114
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 We can consider it like a black swan effect or accident, but on the other hand there was something going on before.

115
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Anyway, low water levels, reduced oxygen levels, pollution and possibility of algal bloom definitely contributed, but these tons of precious metals contributed as well, that's my guess.

116
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Unfortunately, and that's why the project is called "Sorry Odra", meaning you are apologized Odra River.

117
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Poland was slow on reacting, there was near to zero information flow from Poland to Germany and despite some movement and activity in this area no real dynamics was observed.

118
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And because of that I decided to run a small project which is called "Sorry Odra", because there was none to zero monitoring on the Polish side.

119
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And after a year Polish officials decided to run nine stations that constantly monitor the river and share the data.

120
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And this is why I'm here. They monitor oxygen, ACCT, temperature and conductivity.

121
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Unfortunately if you were born in the 90s you don't know how data was shared in the 90s, but basically the data interface they provide you with is a crap, so I decided to do something about it and to create this project.

122
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And the idea, the purpose of the project is to gather data from that source, integrate it, reshare it and visualize it in a very proper manner according to my standards at least.

123
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And what's the goal of the whole project? The goal is to impose pressure on officials to make people aware and acting upon the quality of the water in Odra, but most likely in some more rivers.

124
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And most of you I believe remember the Lufthatten project which changed a lot with respect to air pollution, so of course it's not that easy to run this kind of station, but you can still contribute to the project.

125
00:22:45,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And given that I'm also doing some science, I don't like looking at scientists gathering data and doing data preprocessing, so my goal was to create that and take that obligation from them.

126
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 The website of the project is soreodro.pl, but I believe if you want you'll find it. It provides visualizations, it provides data about the station's reliability, so now I can inform the data sources about the problems in providing that data, maybe they don't look at it.

127
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Technically speaking it's a composition of bash scripts, MariaDB structures, Finks and Grafana. It's MIT licensed and the source code is available on GitHub.

128
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I believe you don't see any visualizations here, but if you know how Grafana works you know what to expect.

129
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And lastly let me share some short and long term goals with you with respect to that project.

130
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Firstly I would like to make that data coming from both sources, meaning from Poland and Germany, because now we are working in a separate manner, so maybe that could be a good meta project to integrate the data from both countries.

131
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Obviously now the project is in Polish, but I'm also working on translating it into English and German.

132
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I would like to collaborate with some people that are somehow aware of the water quality levels and parameter quality, because I would like to introduce a framework that notifies people that the quality dropped below certain thresholds.

133
00:24:40,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And in a long term run I would like to provide a reliable data source for the society, researchers, decision makers, and would like to change the attitude of all the shareholders towards chemical waste and sewage dumping into Odra and hopefully more rivers as well.

134
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 So if you would like to contact me my phone is 4560 and the remaining links are barely visible, but the most important one is soryodro.pl.

135
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And yes this is also the invitation for collaboration because I'm running the project myself and I would be very happy to see more people involved.

136
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And that's pretty much everything I want to say. Thank you.

137
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 [Applause]

138
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Thank you very much. Any questions for him? No? Okay. I think you got the website.

139
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 As a reminder the stream is also recorded so you can just have a look at it later and you will see all the links and everything. You can just copy it.

140
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Alright. Next speaker already standing there. Of course come up. Sure no problem.

141
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I will close this. Here you go.

142
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Do you have the slides there?

143
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Slides for all.

144
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 [Silence]

145
00:26:43,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 [Silence]

146
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 [Silence]

147
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Okay. We apologize for technical difficulties. The talk was supposed to be about a cow sticker collection. We will make sure to get the slides tomorrow. So if you want to know everything about stickers come again tomorrow here same place and maybe we'll find a better solution for the beamer or something.

148
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Anyway thank you and applause. We'll see you tomorrow.

149
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 [Silence]

150
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Okay. Can you all hear me? Okay. Raise your hand if you can see the slides. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. So 50%. So there's not a lot on the slides. Some words and some flying spaghetti monsters so you won't miss much.

151
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 [Silence]

152
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 It's not full screen. Oh we have to talk to the people in the back for that. The beamer doesn't do that. Anyways hello. I'm Sather. I'm a volunteer angel for the camp and I also go by John. You can call me either.

153
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 I come from California. I don't work for the postal service but I love them and I have a message for you. There's something I think needs to happen and I'm here to help that happen. I think there needs to be a church of cryptography.

154
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 So let's talk about our agenda. We'll go over the why there needs to be a church of cryptography. What is a church of cryptography? How you make a church of cryptography? When you should make a church of cryptography? And how you can all help with the church of cryptography.

155
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 So let's begin. I hope this doesn't offend anyone. I'm not here to say one religion is better than another but I hope to convince you mine is the best at the end. I mean ours. Okay so why? Why are we here?

156
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 As creatures of the universe we have the religious rights to communicate with other creatures and gods of our choosing using mathematical principles that hold true across the universe, across time. It doesn't matter if you're on this side of the Milky Way or the other side.

157
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Cryptographic primitives hold true and I think that's a beautiful thing and I think that's one of the unique things that we can all agree upon as creatures of the universe and we get to reflect upon that.

158
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And that enables to do things. These cryptographic principles let us communicate with individual identities securely knowing that with some probability that no one will ever be able to read that and that probability is very high.

159
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 There's more particles of sand than unique identities for some keys and more identities than like atoms in space and time. And I think it's cool that we get to talk to each other securely.

160
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I think it's great and when I have a child I want to talk to my child securely. I want to be Alice, I want my child to be Bob and I want Eve to stay way far away. Eve isn't needed here.

161
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And I come from the land of the US of A and every couple of years, every couple of decades there always seems to be a war on crypto. I survived the war on drugs.

162
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I grew up in the Emerald Triangle and where a lot of people grew cannabis and I understood what it meant to be watched upon by the state and I saw what that did to the people's mindset.

163
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Privacy really mattered. It mattered for your freedom and it mattered for the health and life welfare of your children. And I never understood why weed was illegal. It just didn't make sense to me.

164
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Now encryption, I don't understand why it's illegal. And the US government is constantly trying to edge their way into my matrix servers. I don't want to give them the decryption keys.

165
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I don't know what's going to happen to me if I don't. And what ground do I stand upon to even... Oh I forgot to set my timer.

166
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Anyways, so there's a lot of reasons why I want this and I do think a daughter should be able to talk to their mother in private.

167
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 A prayer should be able to send to the gods of your choosing in private and we have the right to maintain that.

168
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 So now what's a church? What's a church of cryptography? For me, a church of cryptography is just a place to meet and talk about crypto and what it is, how it is, how it came to be, where is it going.

169
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 There's all kinds of things in that space and society is dealing with cryptography in a lot of different applications it never thought it was going to have to deal with.

170
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 30 years ago, nobody would believe that there was magic internet money. But cryptographic primitives made it so. And we all have to deal with those consequences and the freedoms of them.

171
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So in America, creating a religion, it comes right before having the right to own guns. It's part of the First Amendment.

172
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 So the First Amendment gives American citizens the right to free speech and the right to practice the religion of their choosing.

173
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And if that religion doesn't work for most of the people, that's okay. As long as it's not bothering anyone, it's welcome in America.

174
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And so we have pastafarians who are welcome. They believe the flying spaghetti monster and stuff. We have the Native American Church.

175
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 They're allowed to participate in religious ceremonies where certain drugs that are classified as Schedule I narcotics, which are the most illegal drugs in America, they can have those, they can practice those, the people can use those.

176
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And so creating a church is actually a pretty practiced thing in America. I don't know about the German government and the European states, but I imagine you also have similar freedoms here. And I apologize for my ignorance.

177
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 So for us, what do we do? Where's our first place of congregation? It's in the Matrix, and you don't need to take a red pill or a blue pill.

178
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 You just need to go to Church of Crypto, Matrix.org, and find us there, my friends and all these fellow creatures.

179
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 What are we going to be doing? We're going to be learning, we're going to be sharing the joys and pains of life in the cryptographic space.

180
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 We'll be using end-to-end encrypted cryptographic protocols to do so.

181
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And yeah, maybe we'll create some nonprofits across the globe to help facilitate the resources and capital required to spread the love.

182
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 When? The best time is now. Four years ago I was at camp and I wanted to do something awesome, and I didn't know what to do.

183
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And I stand upon the shoulders of giants every day in the open source community, and I see all of you here, and I feel the love, and I think this is one way I can give back.

184
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And I may not be here tomorrow, but I am here today, and this is what I want to do, and I'd love to inspire you to help out. All creatures are welcome.

185
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And it's a great motto, so let's live by it.

186
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 How can you help? Join the channel. Start asking questions, start teaching people what end-to-end encrypted communication is, how it came to be, what are the primitives that make it so, and yeah, learn, love, listen, and grow.

187
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Thank you very much.

188
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 [Applause]

189
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Amen, brother.

190
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Thank you.

191
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Actually, when you said that it's sort of a universal principle cryptography, that reminded me of a thing that Edward Snowden once said. He was talking to Neil deGrasse Tyson or something.

192
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 He was speculating about aliens and Fermi paradoxes, why we haven't seen them, and Edward Snowden said, well, maybe it's just standard for all civilizations to at some point develop cryptography, and it's just common sense to always make it, to always encrypt your stuff.

193
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 So good cryptography cannot be discerned from random noise. So all the space radiation that we get, all the random noise, might be just alien civilizations talking without us noticing. So yeah, maybe that's it.

194
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 [Laughter]

195
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Okay, we're already next one.

196
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 [Silence]

197
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 [Silence]

198
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 [Silence]

199
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 [Silence]

200
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Hello. Okay, one of the principles or advantages of lightning talks that is not being talked about is that you do not get to choose the topic, but I get to choose the topic. So it means that I can talk about something that you might not want to hear, like if you're far away from home, pay attention to where you put your glasses.

201
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Or I can also tell you something that you always wanted to check out, but really never bothered. And depending on whether you can see my presentation, we might talk about one topic or the other. So give me a moment.

202
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 [Silence]

203
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Is there anyone who has trouble reading it? Can you put up your hand? Anyone has trouble reading it, cannot read it? Very few people, so maybe you can rearrange yourselves.

204
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Okay, so Prologue, what is it? It's a programming language, it's a logical programming language, and I bet you heard about it. It's like, what was it, sixth or fourth generation programming language, one generation more than the usual languages that we use today.

205
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Is it actually, why is it different, why is it so, like, why was it hyped in two decades ago, or how is it special, what's so different about it, what can we learn from it, and where is it surprising?

206
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 I had this question a couple of months ago, and as a total newbie, I'm going to give you an introduction of what I learned from Prologue and why it's interesting.

207
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 So what I learned about is that Prologue can be thought of as a language that is basically a database language, and here in the example, we have some data on the top in the data file, can you read it?

208
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Yeah, let's say, so there's three facts, there's a fact, cat Fido, cat Tom, and cat Fritz. So what can you do with the data? You can query the data.

209
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 If you load it into the interpreter using the data directive something, you can see the question mark is the prompt of the interpreter, SWIPL, you can query it using the cat X.

210
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 The capital X means what is it, and as an answer you get cat can be Fido, or it can be Tom, or it can be Fritz. So we query their database and return all the data that they had. Cool.

211
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Another database example, a bit closer to reality, let's imagine that we have an image sensor that can emit data in two combinations, in combinations of formats. One is RGB, the other is UV, and it can return data in some frame rates, but not all combinations are possible.

212
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 So we put in the data, config, RGB, FPS24, and so on, we put on all the combinations, and that gives us a possibility to query it.

213
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 So in the first line you see here, there's config R and underscore. Underscore means we don't care, and R, capital R, means we want this to be listed.

214
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 What are the options when we don't care about the other one? We don't care about the frame rate, we just want the format.

215
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 So if we put in this as a prompt, you get two answers. It can be either RGB or UV. So we query their database for unique values of a certain column in some way, in some interpretation.

216
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 We can also set one column to UV and then query the frame rates, or we can do something more complex. We can return entire configs with this syntax. We only care about configs which have RGB as a result, and then we get the entire configs which have RGB, but also they are already filled in, and so on.

217
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 More general questions in the last line. You have it's flowing off the screen, but you get all the combinations where you query it with two variables.

218
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 And for the finish, can we have a combination of UV with 60 FPS and say false? There are no answers.

219
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 You might have noticed that there are multiple answers sometimes. So it's one of the query languages in this revision. But that's not all.

220
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Let's see this example. This does not look like a query language. We are doing +123. 1+2=3? Yeah, that's right.

221
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And then we are adding 1+2=what? And what is 3? No surprises there. Then we get +a23, like +what to get 3.

222
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Okay, this is kind of unexpected. First we got an answer in the third part, and then we get an answer in the first argument. So it correctly gives us the answer. 1+2=3. So this is surprising, isn't it?

223
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 So you do not get that kind of behavior in normal programming languages. You cannot choose which argument is the output argument, and here you just did it.

224
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 So this is not a function after all. So this is kind of the mix between a query language and a language to figure out things in general.

225
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Let's take a look at a more complicated example. There is a directive, I don't know what it's called.

226
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 There is a thing that is called append, and it appends a list to another list. And the answer is what? What is abc when we add ab to c?

227
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Not surprising, but let's keep going. Here we have a more complicated example, just like we had a plus example.

228
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 So we add a... yes, what will we get if we... from a different perspective. The result is abc, and we are appending a and b to what?

229
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 Okay, five seconds for the answer. Who knows?

230
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Yes, a list containing b. Let's take a look at the answer. And there's going to be another riddle, so think about it.

231
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Wait, c. So there's another riddle. You get... yeah, that's actually more complicated. What do you append to what to get ab?

232
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Okay, there are two positions that you have to fill in. How does a programming language manage to do that?

233
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Five seconds for you to think. One, two, three, four, five. And the answer is, did you get it right?

234
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 There is a list of combinations. First, it's x and y is... x is empty, y is an a and b. Second combination is a is in the first position and b is in the second position.

235
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Third combination is a and b are in the first position and the second position is empty. And I don't know why there is also the answer that is not possible, but okay, I'm just a beginner.

236
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 So who got it right? Hands up. Yay, you're learning. So as you can see, this is not something that can be described as functional programming or anything like that.

237
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Those are not functions. This probably is more of an engine to solve problems that you have based on figuring out the relationship between the facts that you give it.

238
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 And yeah, how does it all happen? This is no magic. If you are trying to declare your own, I don't know, procedure equivalent, you just give it a couple of relationships.

239
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Here the important relationships is a is lower than b, a is lower than c, c is lower than b. And I don't quite remember what it was about.

240
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Ordering that one is between the other. But basically this is a simple example of a function. So you can actually write this. There is no arcane magic behind it.

241
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Actually there is, but not on the level that you are going to deal with normally. Yeah, those are just ensuring that those numbers have been declared as facts before. It doesn't really matter that much.

242
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 But yeah, so this is what I wanted to tell you about Prolog. It's different, it's useful, it's an engine for querying facts, it's an engine for figuring out relationships between facts, and it's not using functions.

243
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 When I was learning it, there was a guy on IRC who was asking questions and trying to write basically Java in Prolog. It was really painful to watch.

244
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 If you try to learn Prolog after this talk, pay attention to unification and backtracking. Those are the two magical concepts that you should learn, because otherwise you're just not going to have fun at all.

245
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 And yeah, this is how you get multiple answers and this is how you solve things like Sudoku using Prolog.

246
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 And if you want to learn more random projects of mine, my website is dorotac.eu.

247
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Or you can come on Friday to KSZone and I'm going to have a talk about embedded REST. I don't know what time yet, but it's going to happen.

248
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 Actually a workshop, so you can also participate, bring your laptops. Thank you very much.

249
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 [Applause]

250
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Thank you. Oh, your glasses are broken? Ah, that's what you mentioned in the beginning.

251
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 Any questions for her? All right, we still have time for one more talk. Ah, you got it. All right, the sticker collection is back online, I think.

252
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Second try, let's hope it works.

253
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 All right.

254
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 [Silence]

255
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Stick.

256
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 [Silence]

257
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 [Silence]

258
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 Test, test. Okay, hello everyone. My name is Moritz. And when Corona hit, I was bored.

259
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 And well, basically the idea is I created a sticker collection because I missed cows, wrens and sticker boxes. And I also have to say that my laptop is like a sticker free zone for various reasons.

260
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 So I thought, okay, let's collect photographs or even better templates of stickers.

261
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 So, yeah, that's easy to replicate. And I went around the internet and looked up where I can find these templates for all these kind of stickers you see in sticker boxes over here, over there.

262
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 And lots of stickers I knew and it was a bit hard to track, but I got quite a lot.

263
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 It's not really good to see here, but basically it's now about over 500 stickers I've collected. It's not all templates.

264
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Some of the stickers you see here, basically it's everything is on GitHub.

265
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 The code itself for this JavaScript and HTML, it's all on GitHub as a site. And you can just put some random name, sorry, some query in that search field, for example, Fryfunk or Chaos.

266
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 And then it will quickly filter out all the tagged images and the source and well, if possible, the author license and stuff.

267
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 And yeah, I did it on GitHub basically because it's easy to track, easy to extend for merge.

268
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 I just wanted to make it easier for other people to just copy and replicate and just in case I got get bored.

269
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 Again, well, let's call it distracted by other projects.

270
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 And yeah, and also a small shout out to other projects, for example, the Chaos sticker collection, no, Chaos sticker operation center, which does something similar.

271
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 There's also HackerArchive.org, thank you. I don't really remember all the links there, which is a bit more detailed with descriptions.

272
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 And yeah, so if you have stickers and you have even better as a template, maybe send it to you, sorry, not to you, to me by email or on GitHub, make a poll request.

273
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 I will integrate it and yeah, then it's for everybody to copy and to modify whatever the license allows.

274
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 And we will hopefully have more accessible stickers, more varieties. That's always good.

275
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 And thank you so much for your attention.

276
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 All right, thank you very much.

277
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Actually, is there a sort of sticker box here at camp or are there several boxes? Does anyone know?

278
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,000
 Yeah, you can tell me later, then I will ask you. Thank you.

279
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 Thank you very much.

280
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 The hour is basically already full. I apologize for the technical difficulties.

281
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 Are there any people here who still wanted to have a talk but didn't have the time?

282
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 Okay, I think we just made it.

283
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 Oh, yeah, okay. So tomorrow, same time, I will try and improve a bit the techniques. So see you again tomorrow.

284
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 See you again tomorrow.

285
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:29,000
