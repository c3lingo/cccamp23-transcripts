WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 All right, without further ado,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 I would like to present LaForge,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 who will be speaking today,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Demystifying eSIM Technology.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Please, take it away.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Okay.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Yeah, thanks.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 So we can get started.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Demystifying eSIM Technology.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 So, yeah, so, well, very quick slide about me.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm a recovering Linux kernel hacker.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 I did a lot of work in the OsmoCom project.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 It's open source mobile communications.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 That's like the actual communications part,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 not eSIM so much.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 It's a completely different topic.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Yeah, participating at the CCC camps

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 and other events for quite some time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I work mostly on implementing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 various telecommunication protocols.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And in my spare time,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I also implement telecommunications protocols,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 but going back to the like 70s and 80s and so on.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So historical telecommunications.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 And as part of that, there's also an ISDN

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 and a PSTN network at the camp.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 So if anyone wants to still connect to that,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 come talk to us.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So after the advertisement break,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 yeah, overview.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So what is this about?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Going to do a little bit of a recap

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 on classic SIM, USIM kind of stuff.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Then talk about principles behind eSIM,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 the different variants of eSIMs,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 and how all of this is put together.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Be warned, this is a rather complex topic.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Like probably almost anything in telecommunications.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 And yeah, this is just a very brief glimpse

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 into what is happening technically.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I mean, this is like dozens and dozens

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 of specification documents and so on.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 So yeah, let's look a bit at the classic SIM

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 to put this into context.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So SIM cards in the telecom networks,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 as we know today, were introduced with GSM,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 the 2G technology.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 That means it was first deployed commercially in 1991.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 The idea of the original SIM card is what we call

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 a single purpose smart card.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I mean, it's a smart card,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 a card that's not just memory,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 but has a processor and an operating system

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 and so on inside the card.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And it only has a single purpose,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 which is to be used in the GSM network.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 The fundamental purpose of that classic SIM card

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 is that you store network configuration data

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 on the card, so you can move the,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 like have operator-specific configuration

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 that you move between the devices.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 You have to move the card between devices.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Back then, also storage of contacts

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 and storage of SMS messages was an important feature.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And last but not least, maybe the most critical part

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 to serve as a secure element for the per subscriber

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 key material for authenticating the subscriber to the network.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 These are the functions of the classic SIM card.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 So then, you know, a decade later,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 around 2000, UMTS 3G was introduced.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 And in that, we went from SIM to USIM.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And this means also to UICC.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 So now, U-SIM probably some people will have heard,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 so it's the UMTS SIM, basically the 3G and beyond SIM card.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And they didn't just create another single purpose card,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 but they also introduced an additional layer,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 which is the UICC, the universal integrated chip card.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So it's a general purpose multi-application card,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 where multiple applications can run on the card.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And the USIM is just one application on the card.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 A classic SIM, in addition for backwards compatibility,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 might be another application on that card.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And later on, when Volte came around for LTE,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 there was also an additional ISIM application,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 ISIM for IMS, subscriber identity module.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 That's what SIM stands for.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So again, configuration data that's for the IMS core,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 IMS being the IP multimedia system,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 being the strange SIP derivative that is used in voice-over LTE

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 and voice-over Wi-Fi networks.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 So by now, we really have thousands of parameters

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 and hundreds of files in configuration on that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 But still, fundamentally, it's the functionality of the secure element

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 to authenticate the subscriber to the network.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 And with the USIM also to authenticate the network to the subscriber.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Whereas in the classic GSM SIM, we only had one-way authentication.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Now with the USIM, we have mutual authentication.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 The same USIM is used in 3G, in 4G, and in 5G.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 There's no change to the authentication, nothing of that sort.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 So a 3G SIM card works for 5G or for 4G or for 3G,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 or even for 2G if it has the backwards SIM application on it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Now with eSIM, basically, we arrive at a point where

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 technology has been created to virtualize the entire USIM.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So not the classic SIM card, but the USIM.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And what that means, we decouple, let's say, like in software virtualization,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 we decouple the operating system and the software from the underlying hardware.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 We do the same in the eSIM universe.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And that happens by having a special chip, which is called the EUICC.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 We had the EUICC as the classic card on which the USIM

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and potentially the iSIM application was running on top,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 but it was still a plastic card that you plug into a phone.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And now we have the EUICC, the Embedded Universal Integrated Chip card,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 which is a chip that's fixed most often.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 It can also be a card form factor, we'll get to that later,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 but in a general sense it is a fixed chip inside the device.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Also there's work being done to actually not have it as a separate chip,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 but have it inside a multi-chip package or even have it virtualized inside a chip,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 but that doesn't really matter to the eSIM specification point of view.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So you have something that behaves like an EUICC chip as specified,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 and that is the physical secure element.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And then we have something called SIM profiles.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 And the SIM profile is basically a software or data description format

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 that contains what a classic USIM would contain,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 what meaning it contains.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Please mute your phone if possible, thanks.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 So we have the contents of the USIM file system.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 I think it was a slide, I didn't speak about it explicitly,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 but all the configuration data is stored in files on a file system in the card.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And all the content of those files, basically there's a description format in ASN1 encoded

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 where you can say, well, this file with this name has this content,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 and there's another file with some other content, and so on.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 So that's part of this eSIM profile description.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And then in addition we have the key material for the cellular network authentication,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 meaning the K and OP or K and OPC values.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 These are the shared secret key material that only exists at the cellular network operator

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 and inside the SIM, and here in this case in the SIM profile.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 In addition to that we have further key material for over-the-air SIM card communication, that's OTA.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 There have been many talks before at CCC events about how OTA works

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 and all kinds of security issues in at least previous OTA implementations and so on.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Feel free to refer to that if you're interested in that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 But that also is part of the SIM.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And that's not part of the file system, so it's listed separately.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Also you have all your PIN values, PIN2, PAC2, the admin PIN,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 and also all the SIM toolkit applets, which are Java applets that the operator can run on your classic SIM or USIM.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 And those are also part of the profile package that gets put together just to form the SIM profile.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 And the eSIM profiles are specified, the format of those profiles is specified in what's called an EUICC profile package format

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 that is authored by the Trusted Connectivity Alliance, which formerly was the SIM Alliance.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 That's a different standardization body than all of the other stuff that I'm going to talk about.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 It's an interesting split of, well, some guys do some specification here and some other guys do specification over there.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 So let's have a quick look at the EUICC.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 I'm sorry for the low contrast in bright sunlight kind of rendering here.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Hopefully on the recording we have that then digital.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 So this is taken from the specs, a schematic overview of the EUICC.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Not going to go through every acronym in here.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 But basically we have a fundamental operating system at the bottom.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And then we have these two large, well, sort of rectangular objects here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 So-called MNO enabled profile and the MNO disabled profile.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 So basically on this card that is symbolized by this diagram, we have two eSIM profiles residing on a single EUICC.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And one of the profiles is enabled and the other profile is disabled.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 So you can have multiple or even many different profiles on an EUICC, but only one of those profiles is always active at any given point in time.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 And you can switch between them.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Now each of those profiles contains a number of things.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 We said already the file system, the access credentials, some certificate authority, security domain.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 We have applets, we have policy rules and whatnot.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 In general, the important part for also later slides and so on is that we have the issuer security domain of the provider, the ISDP here.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And we have outside of the profile the issuer security domain, the ISDR.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 That's sort of the root of the EUICC.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 So we have different security domains within the card operating system.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And every time you install an additional profile, there will be a new security domain and a new container that is isolated from all the other containers running on your EUICC.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 And there's no way how, at least if everything behaves according to spec, of course,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 these containers can escape their protection mechanisms and so on.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So why do we have this kind of complex setup?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 The reason is, and it will get much more complex if you look at all the other parts of the system,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 but the reason is in the end what we are talking about here is the core revenue generator for mobile operators.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 They need to be able to securely identify their subscribers and they need to rely on the fact that SIM cards

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 or even virtual SIM cards in the form of SIM profiles cannot be cloned.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 If they would, the business model would fall apart.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And now we have different operators who are competitors in the market who both install something on a shared chip.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 So they all must trust that the security promises that this chip and the system and everything has

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 protects their vital shared secrets, the key material inside those containers or inside those profiles.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 So that's why there's all this procedural security and certification approvals that we will get into shortly.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 So what's the EUICC? Well, it's a smart card chip.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 We have higher requirements in all kinds of ways on the security side, more crypto,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 more guarantees of isolation between different things on the card,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 various additional cryptographic routines compared to classic SIM cards,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 and all the other bits are really the same. So the electrical interface is identical to a SIM card,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 even though it might be physically packaged in a different package, but it's the same protocol, same transport protocol.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 You can actually purchase also EUICCs in a plastic card form factor.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 You can plug them into a device that doesn't have an EUICC built in or doesn't have an EUICC with the features that you want or something like that.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 So this is really just a packaging aspect.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Each EUICC is identified by what's called an EID. That's the EUICC identifier, unsurprisingly.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 So that's the unique identifier of the EUICC. That is different from the ICC ID,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 which was the unique identifier of a traditional SIM card or used SIM card.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 And since everything is virtualized, the ICC ID of a former physical SIM card now becomes part of the profile package.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 So every profile has its own ICC ID, since it's a virtualized card.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 So we need a new unique identifier for the actual physical card, which is the EID in this context.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So the other thing to always keep in mind when talking about eSIM stuff is that there are three different flavors of eSIMs.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 There is the machine-to-machine eSIM, there is the consumer eSIM, and now there is, since this year, at least specification-wise,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 I don't think anyone has it in the market yet, the so-called IoTs.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Now, of course, the first question that every nerd asks me, "Well, where's the difference between M2M and IoT?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Is IoT not just the new acronym for M2M?" Yeah.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 They could just also have called them the red, blue, and the green card.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Those names are just some random marketing terms.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Just, you know, there's three different systems with different properties and different aspects and so on,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 which we will look into now in the remainder of the talk.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Just keep in mind those are different, and they're not interchangeable, and they're not compatible with each other.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 So this is different systems.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 They share a lot of technology, but they're intentionally different.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So the first eSIM standard that was specified is the M2M model, the machine-to-machine SIM,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 because that was apparently the driving force early on to have some kind of massive fleet of devices out there somewhere

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 that remotely the owner of those devices can provision new profiles and can switch between operators

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 without having to replace physical cards, which makes a lot of sense, of course, from the point of the owner of those devices.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 So in the machine-to-machine model, the user interaction of the end device, the modem or the phone or whatever,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 is not desired or even possible because either there may not be a human user in front of the device

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 or the device may not have a user interface at all.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 So it's some, you know, whatever, you say card tracking device or some whatever machine-to-machine thing.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Now, it uses a server-driven push model to provision and manage profiles.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 So the initiation of deploying new profiles on the card comes from the backend side, from the owner of those devices.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Basically, they decide they want to switch mobile operators and install a new eSIM profile into it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 So that's a push model coming from the backend side.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 The actual download happens over what's called the BIP, the Bearer Independent Protocol,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 which is something that exists also for, I think, well, 25 years or so.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 It's a way how on-card entities, being Java applets or the SIM card itself or parts on the SIM card,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 can communicate with something typically called the OTA platform or the over-the-air platform at an operator.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So it's a channel between some code on the SIM card and some code at the operator that is transparent

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and where those two pieces of code can exchange data, whatever they want.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And this is also used in this context. All the management is remote.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And since all the management is remote, the EUICC must also contain a provisioning profile,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 meaning an initial profile, SIM profile, that's on the EUICC so that it can log onto some random cellular network

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 to then discover, oh, another profile needs to be pushed to me.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Without that provisioning profile, you have a chicken-and-egg situation.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 That's different from the consumer model and other models.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So the elements, I mean, yeah, this diagram is probably hard to read here on the projector.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 We have a couple of network elements here. We have the EUICC in the device.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 We have the EUM, that's the EUICC manufacturer, so the company that produces the EUICCs.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 We have the CI, the certificate infrastructure. We have the SMSR, the secure router.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 And we have the SMDP, the acronyms. We will get to that in actually two slides, I think.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 So, yeah, the data preparation, my bad, sorry.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 So the SMDP is sort of the heart of the backend infrastructure of all of the three eSIM flavors that exist out there.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So data preparation in this context basically means putting together this eSIM profile from various different data sources,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 signing it properly, delivering it properly to the EUICC and so on.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 So it's the preparing, storing and protecting those SIM profiles and downloading those into the EUICCs that are somewhere in the field.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 We have an additional component, the SMSR, which only exists in the machine-to-machine eSIM sphere.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 SR is for secure routing. It's a bit of a sort of, let's say, a one-to-one relationship between the EUICC and an SMSR.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 So an SMSR is some backend software thing running somewhere at some operator in the cloud or wherever.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And the EUICC is the chip that's in the phone.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And when the EUICC gets produced, there is a key material that ties it to one specific SMSR on the backend side.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So those are owned by the same entity or at least initially.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And SMDPs, there can be many. There can be many providers that operate SMDPs and that have SIM profiles and there's like a market and competition and so on.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 But the EUICC and the SMSR are tied together.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And that's sort of the representation of the EUICC somewhere on the backend side.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 The association is created by the manufacturer.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 According to the spec, it's possible to replace it and move to a different SMSR operator.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But somehow the business and the commercial side of the technology don't really enable that to the extent that the specification authors would have envisioned.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 So you again have a lock-in situation, right?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Previously, you were locked into the cellular operator of the physical card you put into your remote IoT or M2M device.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 And now you're locked to an SMSR operator without whom you cannot deploy new SIM profiles to your cards.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So you've given control basically from one entity that you have no control over to another entity that you have no control over.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 So it doesn't really solve the problem of enabling the owner of a fleet of M2M devices to actually do whatever they want remotely on their devices and switch operators as they please.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 So this is an overview slide of the larger process.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 So we have the mobile network operator on the left hand side that provides a profile description, meaning all this contents of the file system and whatever or not, to the SMDP operator.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 The DP again is the data preparation, the core.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 So there's many SMDP operators. I think it's like 20 or 30 even.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 There's a list of GSMA accredited as a competition in the market.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And then they create first what's called an un-personalized profile.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And then there's additional personalization data that's also something that exists in classic SIM cards.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 The personalization data is then basically the per subscriber unique data, right?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 There's data that's shared across all the subscribers like the configuration which roaming networks and what not.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 That's the identical on all the cards or SIM profiles.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 But then there is card individual data like your IMSE, MSISD and all these kinds of things, ICC ID.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And that then gets part of that in the personalization process.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And then you end up with a personalized profile.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And then that profile gets encrypted and signed.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 And then you have a protected profile.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And the protected profile then is downloaded onto the EU ICC through the SMSR.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So the SMSR is the gatekeeper, the proxy, the representation of the EU ICC.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And you must go through the SMSR.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And again, the entity who controls the SMSR controls what you do with your EU ICCs.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 So, okay, that's the machine to machine model.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Now, for most of you guys probably more exciting, the consumer model, what you actually have on your smart devices,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 is different where we have a pull model.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And not a push model from some backend, but we have a pull model where the user does something on the user interface

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 in front of their devices.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 And that triggers the process of then downloading and installing and activating a new profile on the device.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 The profile download is actually specified to use TCP/IP, not just BIP.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 BIP is just a stream of bytes.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 It could be any protocol inside, but in the consumer it's actually TCP/IP that is used in this context.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 It introduces another new element, the SMDS.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 There's no SMSR.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 The DS is the discovery service.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 And also you have something called an LPA, the local profile assistant.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Now, the local profile assistant is a piece of code that typically runs on your smart phone,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 which provides you with some user interface and which then talks to the eSIM backend universe

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 somewhere out there in some data center.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And on the other hand, it talks to your EU ICC inside the device.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 So it's some software, some app that runs onto your device,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 either as part of iOS or Android or whatever the flavor of operating system is that you're using.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Now, the diagram looks slightly different, as you can see here.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 We have no SMSR, so the SMDP can talk directly to the LPA,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 which is the local profile assistant in your device,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 and that talks to the EU ICC, to the chip card or the physical chip, not a card necessarily, inside your device.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And you have all kinds of other interfaces and whatnot.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 I'm not going into all the details here. That would go too far.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Now, the local profile assistant, I mentioned is software on your device.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Now, there's also an evolution of that code, and now that's like the LPA on the device is the LPAD,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 the local profile assistant on a device.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Now, we also have an LPAE, the local profile assistant on the EU ICC.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 So since the EU ICC itself is a smart card with an operating system and software and all kinds of things,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 you can actually move the local profile assistant completely into the EU ICC,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 and then you have an embedded local profile assistant,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 and that is something you can use in a legacy device that does not have a local profile assistant on the device,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 but it's inside the EU ICC.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 So you can use a legacy device that's not eSIM enabled with an EU ICC that has an LPAE embedded in it.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 That's sort of one of the use cases of that.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 The standard case, though, is the LPAD in the consumer sphere.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 So we have the SMDP+.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 I noticed, well, you noticed too, I hope, in the M2M model we had the SMDP,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 and now we have the SMDP+, because it does something more than the SMDP did in the machine-to-machine model.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 So it's the enhanced data preparation.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It does basically all of the things that the SMDP did, all this profile, you know,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 profile personalization, profile protection, and all that stuff,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 but it also has some additional features in there.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Now, again, going through the steps of what the SMDP is doing, or the SMDP+ in this case,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 we first generate the profile package, that's the UPP, the un-personalized package.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Then we have the PPP, the protected profile,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 and then it gets bound, the binding, to one specific EU ICC,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 so it gets cryptographically assigned to that single EU ICC.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 We will get to the PKI infrastructure that's behind that in a second.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 It stores that profile as well until it is delivered to the EU ICC.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 It takes also care of the delivery into the EU ICC, and also some other bits,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 which I skip in considering the timing issues in this talk.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 So we also have the Discovery Service, and the Discovery Service is something like a,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 I can say a notification delivery system, because as I said,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 all of the things that I've been talking about are initiated by the user.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 So the user does something on their smartphone, and it triggers something,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 and it goes to talk to some backend.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 But maybe the backend doesn't really have the data yet that it's asking for, or something like that.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 So maybe the eSIM profile is not ready yet, due to overload or whatnot, or what kind of situations,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 and in this case, the SMDP+ can basically register at the SMDS

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 that there is something pending, some operation, some, I want to notify these cards,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 these EU ICCs, and the LPA in the device is then polling regularly the SMDS.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Well, do you have some kind of notifications for me, yes or no?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 And if yes, then inside the notification, it will know which SMDP+ has some pending operation,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 and then the LPA-D will go to that SMDP+ and grab whatever is there for this EU ICC.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So it's some kind of, yeah, you could think of a poor man's SMSC or something like that.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 So we have the security domains. I touched that very briefly initially when we talked about the EU ICC.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 So we have the security domain of the certificate infrastructure that's all behind this.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 That's sort of the root security domain on the card, on the EU ICC.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Then we have the ISDR that represents the SMSR, the secure router, inside the EU ICC,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 and we have the ISDP. That's then for each of the providers, for each of the mobile operators

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 of which you install the EU eSIM profile, each of those eSIM profiles has an issue

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 or security domain of the provider.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And there can be multiple such issues of security, multiple eSIM profiles, each of those has an ISDP,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 and each of those could point to a different SMDP, so a different backend server

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 who has been creating these eSIM profiles for that card.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Now the actual delivery from the backend side to the card goes through several tunnels,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 which is illustrated in this diagram.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Roughly, let's say there's an outer tunnel that utilizes the existing encrypted over-the-air protocols

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 that exist for classic SIM cards and eSIM cards, and the least common denominator

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 for transporting this over is actually SMS transport, believe it or not.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And then if devices have further capabilities, and for eSIM they should,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 there's other protocols like CATTP or HTTPS in modern implementations,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 and yeah, so that's sort of the outer transport channel.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And then inside there we have an additional encrypted transport channel that's based on SCP-03.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 If anyone has ever done work with Java cards, they will know SCP-03 as the secure protocol

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 how external programs interface with Java applets and Java cards.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 If HTTPS is used as the protocol to deliver, it's TLS version 1.2 with pre-shared keys

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and using the algorithm specified there, so it's a fixed set of ciphers and a fixed TLS version.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Now any people doing stuff with TLS will be like, "Hmm, this is strange."

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 But think about, well, if you actually implement this inside the EU ICC,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 you're talking a very small microcontroller with constrained resources,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 so you maybe cannot do public key cryptography with X.509 and RSA and whatnot,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 but you go to pre-shared key and sort of try your best given the constraints you are.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 So this is a diagram of the certificate change and the security relationships between the different elements.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I'm not going to walk through the diagram, which is probably impossible to read anyway.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 So basically there is one route of trust operated by the GSMA,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 the GSMA being the members club of the public operators of cell phone networks,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 and they have a root certificate, or somebody has that on their behalf,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 and this certificate is used to sign all the different elements in this universe.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So the root certificate is used to sign certificates for the EU ICC manufacturers,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 so they can sign per EU ICC certificates on each EU ICC,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 and then also the root certificate of the GSMA is used to sign certificates of approved SMDP pluses and SMDSs and all these network elements.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 So all of them have to have certificates derived from the same single route of trust operated by the GSMA,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 and in order to get access to that I think I have some slides, compliance security, exactly.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 So the EU ICCs, there's a common protection profile on EAL 4 plus that needs to be certified for the EU ICC,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 then you have certifications for the production environment, the process security,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 so there is different, yeah, the SAS UP for the EU ICC personalization that's on the EU ICC side,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 there is the SAS SM for the subscription management platform, so all the backend infrastructure,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 the software must be certified, the hosting must be certified, the business processes must be certified,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 and of course, I mean, I don't know, but I guess it costs a shitload of money to have any of these things certified,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 I mean, given the complexity of these systems.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Interestingly, AWS now has a GSMA accredited hosting or cloud product,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 so basically if you have a GSMA certified software, you can now run it in a GSMA certified cloud environment by AWS if you want that.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 So in this case, you can afford not to have your data center certified, but you know, Amazon is doing that for you.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Yeah, then also there's functional compliance testing, so all of these software elements actually need to be tested

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 and also certified again by GSMA approved scheme that they have delegated to some entities that do this certification,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 and then of course, all these manufacturers and so on all need to be accredited, and it's all enforced via this PKI.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Basically, if you do not comply with any of those rules, you do not get a certificate or your certificate gets revoked or something like that,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 and then you cannot participate in this club anymore.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 And of course, you need to be a GSMA member as far as I know as well in addition to all of that.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 So, okay, a lot of talk about a lot of things.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Now let's look a bit at the procedures.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 So we now know there are different elements.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 There's sort of these SM things in the backend, and we have the EUICC in the device and the local profile assistant in the device,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 and now each of these, they talk to each other, and there's a couple of different things that they talk to each other.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 The first group of things is remote provisioning, meaning operations called profile download initiation,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 which is a common mutual authentication profile download installation, sort of self-explanatory,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 and then there are so-called local profile management operations about enabling and disabling a profile, listing the profiles on an EUICC.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 You can even set nicknames, you know, can give them cute names, your profiles on the card,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 and there is local EUICC management such as reading the EID from the device,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 because if the local profile assistant, the LPA, wants to talk to the backend, of course it needs to tell the backend which EUICC is actually making the request,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 as memory, that stuff, and so on and so on.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 So let's look at a couple of common operations.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 So this is the first step. If you as a consumer are getting an eSIM,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 that's the first step that's happening, is something called the download initiation,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 and it starts by some kind of contractual relationship between you and the mobile network operator that is issuing this eSIM to you.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 That means billing information, whatever is exchanged,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 and then the operator goes through a backend interface, so the so-called ES2+ interface,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 and talks to the SMDP+ operator, which most often is a separate company that's providing it as a service, it's not your mobile operator.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And the SMDP+ then does some stuff, generates additional identifiers, and so on,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 and it generates, most importantly also, the code that you will use to actually then install the activation code,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 or the most often displayed as a QR code, but actually it's just a string that contains the domain name of the SMDP+ plus some token

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 that sort of identifies which eSIM profile we're talking about here in this operation.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 So that's a pure, it starts with a business operation between you and the mobile network operator,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 it continues with some backend operation to the SMDP+ provider,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 and nothing has actually happened by the end of the concluding that other than you being billed.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Now the next step is the download installation phase, and that's, I know it's small and so on,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 but it's really just a very high level overview of what's happening there.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 We have elements, we have the operator that's the mobile network operator that's selling you a SIM subscription,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 we have the SMDP+ operator, the guy who operates the eSIM backend,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 we have the LPAD, that's again your local profile assistant and the device, and we have the EUICC.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 And now there's some talking going on, so the LPAD needs to query the EUICC,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 like what is your EID and what's the default SMDP+ address, and so on and so on.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 And then there is one line here called just, well, refer to common mutual authentication procedures,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 actions, such and such, and that expands into a diagram that's like three times the size of this,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 which does the mutual authentication between the EUICC and the SMDP+.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 So at the end of this mutual authentication process, by facilitating all these PKI X509 certificates in this entire chain,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 the EUICC knows it's talking to a GSMA accredited and approved SMDP+,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 and the SMDP+ knows it is talking to an EUICC that contains a profile that has been issued by an EUICC manufacturer

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 who has received a certificate from the GSMI public key infrastructure.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 So basically they both know they can trust each other because they're part of the same chain of trust.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 And from that point onward then, the actual profile building and so on gets started.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 It goes on for some time, and then we come to a process called the profile installation,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 where the LPAD and the EUICC exchange a number of commands, so-called APDUs, that's smart card packets,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 basically communication packets that go back and forth.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And when all of this has happened, at some point we come to a profile that has been successfully installed on the EUICC.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Now, a newly installed profile is by definition explicitly not activated.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 It's downloaded and installed, but it's not active.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 The act of activation is something you have to do explicitly by using a local profile management operation

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 between your LPAD on your device and the EUICC.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And the next step is the enabled profile device, where really it's only the end user using the LUI,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 the local user interface, doing some end user interactions, the thing that end users do.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And then we have the EUICC and the device baseband.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Now, where does the device baseband come into this?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 If you switch your SIM profile, the baseband processor that handles all the cellular protocol stuff with the network,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 it needs to invalidate all the information it may have ever read from the SIM before,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 including the IMZ and everything else, because your SIM has completely changed now.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 It basically needs to invalidate all that, and that happens by a so-called refresh command.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So during this process it's basically determined whether refresh is needed.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 In most cases, yes.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 And if a refresh is needed, the EUICC, using something called proactive SIM,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 which inverts the direction of the SIM communication,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 because a SIM card can normally not initiate communication to the baseband.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 It's only the other way around.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 So there's a piggyback mechanism, how it can tell basically the baseband,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 hey, by the way, all the information you think you knew about the SIM card is now invalid.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 You need to basically start from scratch.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 And it comes, restarts, and starts to read all the information from the SIM card,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 and it determines it now is a new IMZ, and it needs to roam to a different network,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 and it does the network registration, and so on and so on.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 So that's what's happening once you enable a new profile in the card.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 Now, that is the consumer model.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Now let's get to the exciting new buzzword, the IoT model.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Now, machine-to-machine consumers and now IoT.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 Now, the IoT model has been developed mostly to overcome problems

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 in the machine-to-machine eSIM model,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 where I already hinted this, there's the problem of sort of the business side

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 and the legal side not really being able, the commercial side not being able to agree

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 on transferring sort of the SMSR from one SMSR operator to another

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 in the machine-to-machine case.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 And now they created something which I think is actually really nice.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I'm rather happy with how it worked out.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 So we take a lot from the consumer eSIM.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 So the IoT eSIM has much more in common with the consumer eSIM

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 than with the machine-to-machine eSIM, which is sort of paradoxical if you think about it,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 but it is the way, this is the way.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And it's sort of like a consumer eSIM that's remote controlled.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 So instead of having this completely separate scheme with the SMSR

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 and whatever kind of operations and the push model,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 what we do is we use the consumer model,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 but instead of a local user entering an activation code,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 we sort of have a remote user that injects the activation code

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 so it can do the thing to activate a new eSIM profile.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 And that's nice in a way that we do away with this dependency on one entity

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 that has the control over this EU ICC,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 and we get to the whatever, 30 or so entities that compete

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 which is slightly better than one entity.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 And the way how they do it is they take the LPA,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 so the local profile assistant that's running in your smartphone,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 and they split that in half.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 And the upper half of the LPA becomes the EIM, the EU ICC Identity Manager,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 which is yet another piece of server software running somewhere in a data center.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 And the lower part of it becomes the IPA.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 It's not a beer unfortunately, it's the IoT profile assistant I think.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 And the IPA is sort of a user interface less LPA

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 introducing an interface to the EIM, which is the server side infrastructure,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 which then does the same thing as the user would have done,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 such as sending an activation code to install a new eSIM profile in there.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 So the goal I set was to work around these problems with SMSR migration and machine to machine.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 So it turns out that IoT devices occasionally tend to be even smaller

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 in terms of CPU resources on their application processor

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 than the machine to machine devices in the past.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 So it might be overkill to require that they actually implement a full blown HTTP and TLS stack

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 that might be difficult in some environments.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 What they did is they worked this new interface between the IPA and the EIM,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 the eSIM IoT Remote Manager, called ESIPA, that interface.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 They designed this in a way that it can be spoken over.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 First of all, there's two different encodings.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 There's JSON encoding for high powered devices that can handle textual representation,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 there's an ASN1 representation for low powered devices that need binary encoding formats,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 and each of those encodings can be transported either over HTTPS or over CoAP,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 which is an IoT related protocol for resource constrained devices with Datagram TLS,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 which is simpler than the TCP based TLS as we know it in HTTPS.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 You can even implement a completely custom transport if you want to,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 because as an owner of a fleet of I don't know how many IoT devices out there,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 you can of course put some code as IPA on your device and some other code as EIM in your backend

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 and they can talk about whatever protocol they want,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 just as long as they can encapsulate all the operations and whatever that is needed.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Of course you won't be able to interoperate with other devices,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 but technically it's possible in the spec even explicitly says,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 "Yeah, if that's what you want to do, you can do it."

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 So, yeah, it can be remotely triggered.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 So basically the customer of such an IoT subscription,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 so you buy 100,000 IoT eSIM profiles and as a customer you would operate your own EIM

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 or you would contract some party, a third party that is neither your operator nor the EUICC manufacturer,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 a third party that really just works for you to operate that EIM or your operator in-house.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 And through this EIM you can remotely install whatever profiles you want on your IoT fleet of devices

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 and nobody else can basically tell you not to do that other than the GSMA,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 but that's not their role.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So, yeah, that's sort of what's new in the IoT model.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Now, last part, just a couple of slides about eSIMs versus private networks,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 which is a topic that's also relevant to here at the CCC because this private seller network operated here.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Now, the entire GSMA eSIM universe has been built around a couple of assumptions,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 which I think were even wrong back then and they were even wrong right now.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 So, well, a central root of trust, okay, I mean, if you're a GSMA, of course that's what you want, right?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 I mean, you want to be the root of trust, that's sort of understandable.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 GSMA members or accredited parties issuing profiles, okay, I can still understand that,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 but then there is, for example, the requirement that you need public Internet access

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 to reach all of these SMDP, SMSR, SMDS devices, which, yeah, well, I have this private network of whatever.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 I don't want those devices to talk to the public Internet,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 but in order to install new eSIM profile, they now need Internet access.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Yeah, not the smartest idea.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 And then also the OTA mechanisms, they all require an initial trigger of SMS.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 So, in your private network where maybe you have data-only devices and you have no use for SMS or voice calls

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 and you would now have no technical reason to deploy that technology,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 you now need to deploy an SMS service center just so you can trigger the HTTPS connection activation,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 so you can download eSIM profiles over public Internet access from devices that you never wanted to have public Internet access before.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 So, yeah, well, so in private networks, you know, and I'm talking about, you know, the event networks like here,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 or also campus networks, let's say, at a car manufacturer or whatnot, that's not really what they want in the end.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Yeah, thanks. I'm coming to the end here.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 Yeah, so, yeah, you might not be a GSMA member, your network might not be public,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 you might not want public Internet access, and you might not want to have to deal with legacy SMS.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 So, yeah, there is sort of a disconnect between what's happening in, you know, the cellular world and in the eSIM world to some extent.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Now, what you can do is basically give two options.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 Either you are part of this GSMA world, and that means you have to comply with all those requirements and so on,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 and your profiles are over the public Internet, and actually you're working in a system that's meant for public networks,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 but actually you do use them in a private network because you have no other way,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 or you theoretically, I don't think anyone does that, at least not yet, you would operate your alternative own route of trust,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 like CA cert was created to sort of as an alternative to commercial CA's,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 where then you would run your own SMTPs, SMSRs, and all that infrastructure.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 The problem is then you cannot work with a normal consumer device because the EUICC in there has a certificate from the route of trust of GSMA,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 and that would of course not accept any of the certificates of your own CA.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 So that can only work in a situation where you produce your own devices and put EUICCs on those devices,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 or like in a plastic form factory in a SIM slot that have certificates derived from your own PKI in there, right?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 So that's sort of, yeah, both choices are rather bad.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 So here at the camp the solution is obviously go for the first part because people come here with normal consumer devices,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 so this time is the first time that the GSM team has some eSIMs available, if you ask them,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 this is a limited supply because it's of course much easier to buy physical SIM cards than to buy a blob of data,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 it's of course in much more limited supply than physical cards.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 And the problem is, well, of course you have to do this through some service provider,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 and it's all done by the service provider, you can't run off all of that, you can't run it on premises,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 you can't control what's happening, it's basically all out of your hands, and that's sort of the negative part of it.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 And it also means that this service provider then knows of course the EID of all the people who have joined this camp here,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 and if you buy a physical card here nobody knows except maybe some of the people here,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 but at least nobody off site and not some company somewhere.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 So, yeah, I forgot, one more slide.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 So me being an open source guy, what can we do with open source in this universe?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 And the answer is, well, technically everything, but then how do we get all of this accredited and approved and whatnot,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 and authorized so it can be used in production environments?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 So all of the specs are public, you can implement all of that, but you can't really use it with consumer devices

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 because your software won't get the GSMA approval, and your hosting at home won't get GSMA approval,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 and so yeah, sort of stuck there.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Now in the IoT eSIM, luckily there are two components which do not require GSMA certification,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 which is the IPA, the local software running on the device, and also the EIM, the EICC identity manager,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 which is the part that you as an operator of a fleet of IoT devices want under your control.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 So there's some chance of at least having free and open source implementations there.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 And for the LPA or IPA, Google actually released the one that's used in Chrome OS as open source software,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 so if anyone wants to look at how this is done, you can do that and port that to a general,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 you can buy an EICC in a normal form factor, plug that into your laptop,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 and then try to run that local profile assistance from Chrome OS to get a feel of what's happening there,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 what does the protocol messages look like, and so on. That's actually possible.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 Okay, and with that we come to further reading and the end of file,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 and we hopefully still have a few minutes for questions and hopefully some answers as well.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Please raise your hand as a signal angel, and yeah, thanks.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 [Applause]

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 Yeah, so we...

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 So we have decided to extend Q&A if there are questions.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 We are extending Q&A, so hopefully there will be enough time for questions.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Yeah, please line up here with the gentleman in the shirt over here, the violet shirt.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 Yeah, blue shirt.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 Yeah, thank you for the talk.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 So I have a question. So I have a phone that can do eSIM, and it has two SIM slots,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 so I can install ten SIM cards to my phone, but I can only activate two of them, so in whatever combination.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 What is the reason for this?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 Well, that is a general issue with cellular networks and how they work in a sense that

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 the entire spec and everything is designed in a way that there's one subscriber using one modem being attached to one network,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 and if you think of it physically, how it works, different operators get different spectrum,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 and your modem needs to tune to one particular frequency, right, and it can only be at any given point in time on that one frequency.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Now, if you have a dual SIM phone, that usually means you have also a dual baseband phone, at least these days,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 which means you basically have two complete cellular modems in there,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 and they can be on two channels of two operators or two technologies and so on.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Thank you for talk. One thing I didn't get is you've succeeded in doing eSIM here,

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 which means that you got through a lot of hoops, but what is the limiting factor for the eSIMs in the camp?

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 No, I mean, first of all, I had no involvement with the eSIM here at the camp, just to be clear.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 As in the GSM team, I don't know what they did and whom they talked to and whatnot,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 but I guess it's basically those limited number, I think it's about 350 or something like that,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 they got for free from some company and that's the quantity they got for free.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 I guess that's sort of the...

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 They rely on the company that's generated...

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 Yes, of course. There's no other way you can do it with a general consumer device that has the GSM able to trust that you can't do anything else.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Hello, if I were to route my phone and have control of the operating system, would that solve the problem with the certificate?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 No, it does not, because all of this happens inside the EU ICC itself.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 So there is no reason... like you can do whatever you want on the phone, on the baseband, you can route it, you can do whatever you want,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 but in the end, let's say the secure connection is always between...

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 encrypted connection is always between some code inside your SIM card and some code somewhere in the cloud.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 So the goal here obviously is to just get some numbers over the year into your EU ICC.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 In your professional opinion, if I may say so, was there any way that the protocol suit could have been made simpler without compromising usability or security?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Yeah, I don't really know, to be honest.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 It's not really my... I've never designed any of these systems.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 I just look at them and think about them and work with them.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 So yeah, I don't really know.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 As usual, when you have some kind of specification group, there's different people with different interests.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 Some of them, well, a very small amount of them being technically, and all the other interests are commercial, and then they clash,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 and then everybody wants to get their pattern in the standard and whatnot, and then you end up with something horribly complex, you know, designed by a committee.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Thanks for the talk.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 If I wanted to have my own commercial device, like a consumer device, and connect it to my own network,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 and I wanted to put an eSIM on there, what hoops... So I understand that I would need to have that signed by the GSMA.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 What hoops would I have to jump through to get that done, assuming that I want to have my own set of parameters that I put in the unpersonalized profile and the personalized profile?

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Well, basically you need to find an SMDP+ operator with whom you enter in a commercial arrangement,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 so you can give the profile data to them and they would create the protected profile for you assigned in this chain of trust and so on.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 Yeah, and I don't know the commercial terms and so on.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 If you want a list of those companies, there's a GSMA website that lists all of these accredited SMDP+ operators.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 Yeah, but I guess, you know, mostly they would be interested, like, if you want tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, but not fewer than that.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 So that's sort of a bit of a problem there.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 Hey, thank you for the great talk.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 On the M2M eSIM model, what would happen if the SMSR provider were to go bankrupt?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 It's probably a question of the escrow language in your commercial contract with that provider.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I don't know whether there's any... I'm not... like, that's more, I say, a business process kind of thing.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 It's not really... I'm looking at the technical specs here.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 It might be that they have foreseen this and there is some kind of part of the eSIM specs that cover those business aspects,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 but I'm not aware of, like, any requirement there.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Hi, thanks for the talk.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 I think early on you mentioned the possibility of virtualizing the EU ICC within the general processor.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Does this perhaps hint at the possibility of an EU ICC where multiple EU ICCs could be run perhaps with different routes of trust?

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Yes, potentially.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Though it would mean that, of course, you would have to be able to execute code in the context of wherever this EU ICC,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 if you want to call it like that. I think it's called an EU ICC then or something like that.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 I think I've heard that term in the industry.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Yeah, you would have to execute it with that level of trust and I'm not sure in which kind of secure enclave Voodoo in those processes they're trying to do that.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 So, also doesn't look like a very easy path.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 So, speaking of secure enclaves, if I understand correctly, any profile could be installed in any EU ICC,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 which means that there is a single key extraction standing between us and accessing all the secrets of all the possible EU ICC devices.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 So, if we manage to extract one set of secrets, then we can create a fake EU ICC that would pass attestation?

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 No, I mean that would be the case if it was a shared secret symmetric cryptography thing.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 But there's actually a public key. It depends on which specific interface and so on, but in the end,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 if you get in any kind of PKI, if you get to the private key of the root CA, then the system is owned.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 But, of course, in any PKI you try to make that as hard as possible.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 If you just break the key of one particular device, you never would be that device, but not the overall system, right?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Yes, but I could install another eSIM profile in that same device and extract the keys from that eSIM profile too.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 No, you would not, because in order to install an eSIM profile on an EU ICC, you need a certificate of an SMDP+.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 And not a certificate of an EU ICC, right?

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 So, it's a different tree in the PKI hierarchy and all the code in place.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Of course, it makes sure that you cannot use a certificate of an EU ICC and impersonate an SMDP+ or something like that.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 Okay, maybe next question. Yeah, thanks. We still have time? Okay.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Following the idea of PKI hierarchies, I mean, there are a lot of issuing CA's, however, they are probably called involved in here.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 And this would require revocations. Are they being properly done? Are there such revocation events already happened?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 And did they arrive at all devices? Can you say anything about that?

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 I did not look into that, sorry. I wish I knew. But yeah, sorry, didn't look at that.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 In the IoT spec, how do we do the communication between the EIM and the IPA if we don't already have a different profile?

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Is there like some facility or do we have to flash some initial network contract?

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 You can, well, I think there's different ways how you can do that.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 Well, first of all, the device could have some other network technology by which you could reach, and there could be anything, right?

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 So assuming you're designing an IoT device and you can at least run some custom software on that IoT device,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 you can implement whatever protocol you want to talk to whatever part of software you have somewhere else over whatever medium.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 And then that software basically is a part of your EIM that talks over the public Internet to the SMDP+ and to all of that.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 So because that is not possibly technically with the earlier E-SIM profiles, but because the way how the IoT was designed,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 basically you are enabled to be a proxy in there, and the proxy can of course have multiple parties and tunnel over whatever protocol.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 And it could also be that this other medium is a couple of test points in the factory while you're producing the device.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 That's also a medium by which you could facilitate that transfer.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Okay.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 All right, I believe that's all of the questions. Once again, thank you LaForge.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Yeah, thanks.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000
