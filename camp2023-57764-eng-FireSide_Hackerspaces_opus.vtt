 >> Welcome to our fireside chat tonight with our guests, Africa and Mitch Altman. I'm your moderator, Scotty Allen.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:49.280
 Tonight we'll be discussing hack spaces and make spaces. Maybe to get started, I'll have each of you introduce yourself. Africa, would you please start?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:02:18.280
 >> Sure. So I'm Africa, known as Africa in the chaos family. My name is Sandra also. And yeah, where to start? I'm in chaos family since 2010, actively at the events, but also part of working group against data retention, for example, starting in 2007 when we worked against state surveillance in Europe.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 And in Germany. And I was running Republic program. So that is something really inspiring and great to do. So got to know a lot of amazing people through that also.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 And since 2018, I'm part of a global network of hackers, makers, social innovators that's called global innovation gathering. So I'm working for this also as my day job, which is an amazing privilege to have as a day job.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 So to bring together like 170 people from all over the world, African countries, South American countries, Asian countries mostly, but we also have quite a few members nowadays in Europe.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 And working in anything around open hardware, around openness and sharing of all kinds of patterns and knowledge and like things we learn throughout creating hackerspaces, creating innovation hubs, creating social change in communities.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:39.280
 So that's the thing I'm doing day to day. So that's just really nice. Fantastic. Mitch, would you like to introduce yourself? Sure.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.280
 My name is Mitch Altman and regarding like hackerspaces, makerspaces, etc.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 The intro to me was being invited to my first hacker conference in 2006 to give a talk about TV be gone, which is one of my inventions that I became internet famous for.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.280
 Turns off televisions in public places. I've made a living on that since 2004. Kind of crazy.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 And in the audience in this, yeah, it was actually HOPE conference, Hackers on Planet Earth in 2006 was my first hacker conference.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 In the audience there when I gave my talk was Constanza from CCC who invited me to come to the following Congress 23C3 to give basically the same talk.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 And I did and the first hacker conference changed my life tremendously. I met so many people I'm still close friends with and I've been helping organize with HOPE ever since.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:53.280
 And then coming to Berlin where I fell in love with Berlin and met so many people there who I'm still close friends with and just opened up this whole network that I had no clue existed before.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 And the community I felt was so incredibly positive where everyone's teaching and sharing and learning together and I couldn't wait till the next one.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 And the next one was Camp 2007 not too far from here.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 And there were people, German hackers who were researching and near the end of their research for what would become the hacker space design patterns.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:38.280
 And they through that encouraged everyone who was there to start their own hacker space to learn from what's worked and what hasn't worked from hacker spaces around the world which was pretty much mostly just Germany and one in Austria.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 And because of that me and Brie Pettis and Nick Farr started three of the early hacker spaces in the US.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.280
 Noisebridge, NYC Resistor, HackDC.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 - Luckily all around the same time, right?

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.280
 Yeah, same time 2007-2008. And we had a lot of help. We helped each other. Other people were excited about it. Everyone's watching.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:12.280
 And it turned out to be huge success for everyone. And wow, there was a lot of work. There was a lot of ups and downs. But overall it felt really great to be doing that.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:22.280
 And as a result all of that plus the hacker spaces that exist here along with the hacker space design patterns which by then were published online.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:34.280
 It became examples and people helping each other to form new hacker spaces and encouraging more and more of this. And soon there were several hundred and then thousands around the world of hacker spaces.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:43.280
 So I've been involved with helping hacker spaces ever since and sharing what I've seen work for Noisebridge.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:58.280
 The one I helped start and then learning from other ones and see what problems they have and how they solve them and sort of cross-pollinating and helping people overcome problems and also grow better as a result.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280
 So yeah, that's probably a good enough intro for now.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 Fantastic. A quick introduction for me. I'm Scotty Allen. I run a YouTube channel called Strange Parts.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 And it's actually really a great honor to do this because Mitch, you're a huge part of the reason I'm here today and doing what I'm doing.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:27.280
 And your work in encouraging hack spaces and make spaces across the world has pretty fundamentally changed my life.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:41.280
 We met originally through Noisebridge in San Francisco and I later became a member of Noisebridge and was very active and that led to me going to Hope and going to Congress and coming to camp in 2015.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 And then that led to me going on a hacker trip to China with you to go visit a whole bunch of hacker spaces there.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:08:08.280
 And I immediately fell in love with China, which then later led to me wanting to make videos to share with people back home at Noisebridge, which led to me somewhat accidentally starting a YouTube channel and becoming my full-time preoccupation and occupation.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.280
 So this conversation is near and dear to my heart.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.280
 Well, professional hackers.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.280
 Yeah, kind of. Which is a weird thing to say.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:28.280
 I wanted to start with, you know, I think the audience that's watching this knows broadly what a hacker space is.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.280
 And initially I thought I wouldn't ask this question.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280
 But based on conversations with both of you today, I think it's worth asking, which is what are we talking about?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:51.280
 What is a hack space? What is a make space? And maybe what else can we fit in this category that wouldn't call itself a make space or a hack space, but is this same type of space or community or has similar intentions?

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.280
 Yeah, I'll put it up to either one of you.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:09.280
 Yeah, we always define it, of course, as in some way volunteer run. So where you can do all the different things community led so that you're creating things that you want to use yourself.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:24.280
 Like you create the workshops, you create the living room situation and all the things that you want to create yourself and for the people around you that maybe don't have the capacity to create it themselves.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:47.280
 And yeah, we have many people in the network who are running also like we would see it as like we from the chaos family would see it as commercial spaces like labeled as innovation hubs or labeled as like spaces where startups are incubated or where you can create products with the hardware.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.280
 And so those may not be entirely volunteer run, right?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:10:02.280
 Yeah, totally. They are like they have business models and we think business models could be something. Yeah, we look at it.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:21.280
 But I wouldn't call those hacker spaces, but I think in many regions, it's super important to say these still qualify. They do the same cool things that we do here, but they need some kind of substance to run so they can't run purely on the donations from the members, for example.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280
 So in some ways, I would even include them sometimes.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:41.280
 Yeah, certainly there's overlap. And back back in the earlier days of these sort of startup incubator things. There was one in China called hacks or hacks elevator, which became hacks.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:11:05.280
 Excuse me. The dust here and my lungs are hurting. Sorry, but it's worth it. And the hacks elevator started off being pretty interesting. I think it's start bringing people from the outside in to be part of this infrastructure of China for developing so easily with all of the infrastructure there just readily available at your fingertips.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:28.280
 And you could do so much magic that way. But there were so few back then of Chinese people doing that. And the idea at the beginning anyways was to have outsiders come and then have that be a setup for people within China to start growing into so they can make a living doing meaningful projects near and dear to their heart.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:57.280
 And so it was very much that the name hacks elevator was appropriate. It nowadays is more of just your run of the mill kind of VCs venture capitalist investors coming in and with the promise of we're all going to get rich and and just manipulating people into doing startups so that these investors can sell stock and get out before everyone else realizes how little value he's shares of stock.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:17.280
 Pump and dump or pyramid scams. Anyways, that's not the people I'm talking about. Exactly. That's what things have become. And you know we live under capitalism we probably all noticed and wherever money can be made it will and it doesn't matter what the other consequences are.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:31.280
 And so anything we do will be used by some people for this. But that doesn't mean that we can't use what we have to do things that continue to be meaningful for us personally for those around us.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:55.280
 And at Hacker Spaces that's kind of what it's about these physical spaces where people come together in community to support one another to encourage each other to learn and I like encouraging people to find projects that other people might also find meaningful and if that's the case then that's exactly what other people might pay you to offer.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:09.280
 And then you can share that and make a living on a project you love just like I do from TVB gone and gives me the time to go around giving all the workshops and everything that I do to be a professional hacker whatever them.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:22.280
 And like I'm doing here just doing all these workshops and being totally exhausted and loving it. And yeah so these physical spaces are about in my view the community is the main thing.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:49.280
 And then we have tools that people within the community feel are important that they can get the resources to acquire to allow the people to do the projects they think are totally fucking cool and awesome and hopefully that some people at least can make a living on to support themselves and other people around them hiring some people whatever to grow some local economy that can help so many people and who knows what happens from there.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.280
 So but that's kind of my my personal thing.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.280
 Hacker spaces don't have to have have to have that.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280
 I like it when they do.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:06.280
 But yeah so the tools that the hacker spaces maker spaces fab labs all these different names.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:21.280
 Even accelerators if they share that mindset. It's just sharing that mindset in the community aspects of encouraging teaching sharing learning with one another that I think is the most important thing and that's for me what defines these kind of spaces.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:35.280
 Yeah, I agree that this kind of openness this like also welcoming new people and being inclusive of different kinds of like perspectives and new people is super important.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.280
 Yeah, no one and then I mean the design patterns apply right.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.280
 Yes, absolutely.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:50.280
 So yes, we just a word about design patterns. If any of you out there listening watching don't know about the design patterns look that up.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280
 Yes, please.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:15:05.280
 Yeah, there's there's a website that we started in 2008 to encourage people to come together and support each other for hacker spaces maker spaces etc. Hacker spaces.org. And we all know about here we talked about it earlier.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:23.280
 But on there is the original design patterns plus a whole bunch that people have added before. And this is what's worked and well and not so well for hacker spaces around the world. And it's way worth reading for pretty much any kind of community group, because there's great, great advice there.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:38.280
 It doesn't mean that just because it works here you should do it or it didn't work there so you shouldn't. But just think about these things and learn from it we can learn and help one another this way, hopefully a way of passing on lessons that other spaces have learned the hard way.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:54.280
 And, and hopefully, providing patterns and templates of how to avoid that yourself and and not having to necessarily learn every pitfall or potential challenge through first principles, but rather hard knocks experience.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:03.280
 Yeah, yeah, that's very hard like some, some failures to have to do yourself to really learn what's important for community.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:21.280
 Absolutely. Yeah, you can you can read about it and then you have already been warned and you don't need to bring it until like the last minute, or maybe at least can identify when you're starting to hit one of the one of the pitfalls and and know to go sort of look at what other people have done to get around it.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.280
 Yeah, like, oh, this is what they meant.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:42.280
 Yeah, yes, yes, exactly. One of the things that I wanted to touch on and ask is, I think when a lot of people think of hacker spaces they think very specific types of activities they think of electronics they think of computers they think of 3D printing.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:17:00.280
 And I think, I think we all somewhat implicitly are talking about a lot more but I'd like to make it explicit for the audience what what types of spaces. Are you thinking are you each thinking of when you think of this broader community whether it be hack spaces make spaces

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:14.280
 centers. You know, fab labs. What are we talking about and what what potentially maybe should we be including in this that we as a hack space community don't currently.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:36.280
 So much that maybe it's not in the traditional sense of the word but for like for the German hacker community there are many many things also the political hacking that was already there in the 80s so that's something when I joined chaos that more and more talks at the Congresses

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:48.280
 and camps became like political and some people were criticizing this, but it's like inherent in the whole mindset I would say about that why, why is it inherent.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:18:17.280
 Because you're repurposing at all levels, like you're hacking politics, trying to take all technologies and also apply them to new things and I was thinking also about things like more and more people in the last 10 years or 15 years started to also to do bio hacking for example and also like body hacking all these kind of different things and everywhere and all like things there's always hacking as a term

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.280
 also in like buzzwords and major.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:30.280
 Yeah, public discussions so it's not. It's not a term anymore that we have exclusively for us maybe it never was.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:46.280
 But, yeah, all these kind of things that are super interesting to look at that happened 200 years ago or 500 years ago like fermentation, how did we create our food traditionally so that it served our bodies.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:19:06.280
 The last 2000 years maybe and then only in the past 100 or 80 or I don't know how long since after World War Two maybe we started to have this kind of industrialized food system where we don't prepare the grains, the wheat or the maize anymore like we should with fermentation.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:29.280
 So more and more people get this kind of health issues. And this is all knowledge that is resurfacing slowly and with bio hacking with food hacking is also, yeah, rediscovered in this kind of community which I find so so cool and it's so important to refine and also this connection with nature.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:40.280
 Like Dynacon as a concept of bringing together environmentalism and making and hacking is super cool.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.280
 Yeah, it's super like evolving.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.280
 You probably have more.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:20:10.280
 We all know a lot. So, there's a couple things there that make me a couple points I want to make from what you said. So, politics is, I also agree inherently a part of this whole scene in the country that I used to live in politics is kind of something people are allergic to.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:24.280
 And bringing the concept of politics up directly makes people very uncomfortable especially lately, where things are so polarized over there, and all over the world to varying degrees.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:52.280
 So when we started noise bridge, it was explicitly political. We were a whole bunch of people who kind of identified in our own brands of anarchist hippie weirdo punk queer whatever. And we saw that everything we did had an effect in the technologies that we use whether it's biology or food or tech of various sorts have consequences.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:21:18.280
 And throughout my life and throughout all the lives of people involved. We saw how these consequences were not always positive, because again we live under capitalism that surrounds us and everything we put out into the world will be used for whatever out of our control, and people will use it just to make profit regardless of the other consequences which almost guarantees that it will be negative consequences.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:35.280
 So how do we create things and put it out into the world, so that it creates more good than harm. And that's an open question ongoing and it keeps changing as the technologies change is what we do and what we put out in the world, whether it's electronics whether it's biology, whether it's art.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:53.280
 Art so often by people in these groups goes out into the world and it just gets turned into an effective marketing scam. And we're all manipulated very easily by that and that's why I made TVB gone so I'm just as easily manipulated as everyone else even if I intellectually know it, it still harms me.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:10.280
 And so I didn't want to be exposed more than necessary so I can turn that shit off, but and make it available to others. So, but that that's sort of another point. The, the mindset, along with the community is really important.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:26.280
 And so whether people are explicitly thinking that politics is something we should avoid, which still is kind of mind boggling to me because everything we do has effects outside of us. But, you know, if the community comes together and they want to do art.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:42.280
 Fantastic noise bridge what grew out of this one group that still exists in San Francisco dork bot. And that was before hackerspaces this international thing and big cities mostly where people get together and they have speakers and presentations.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:58.280
 And it's also very social and friendly way for geeks to come together and sort of broaden their horizons and have fun doing so in San Francisco the dark bot was quite often an intersection of art and tech of various sorts.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:14.280
 It was fascinating and so noise bridge growing out of that community in a big way. We had a lot of visual arts a lot of craft. And that's something people don't usually think of when they first hear the word hackerspace or makerspace.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:27.280
 And, but I think it's really really important, because it's all about creativity and not just tech, I can make money. How am I going to make money.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:56.280
 I'll do a startup. Yeah, what will the startup be about. I don't know we can sell stock, whatever. So, but it's really about the creativity and just to harp harken back to what I said earlier, if we can have a space that encourages people to explore whatever realms it doesn't matter if it's tech, bio, food, art, craft, whatever, whatever the community is into or individuals in the community are into people could be encouraging each other to explore and find things they didn't necessarily necessarily even know.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:14.280
 They were interested in until they came to a hackerspace and saw these people doing some cool things on a sewing machine or whatever. And that can change their life. And some people will find projects that maybe they end up making a living from or change the course of their life in a positive way.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:31.280
 And so, the exact realm doesn't have to be tech or whatever, but it's still changing the world around them and then more people and all of us in some way. And that's politics.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:51.280
 We've all traveled a fair amount internationally and I assume you've traveled and visited some of your tiny place, tiny bit. You're connected with many hack spaces and make spaces around the world and as are Mitch and I and we've visited some.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:25:08.280
 I'd love to talk a little bit about what what is happening at hack spaces, make spaces, innovation centers outside of the West. So, Europe and North America.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:27.280
 What what types of things are happening in, you know, the hack spaces make spaces in developing countries in the global south. What, how does it differ from what we think of, you know, traditionally as, you know, German or American hack spaces.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:49.280
 There's so much. One of the really cool examples I would want to share is like in Brazil. We did a project that was about open hardware in health care and we worked together with Institute of Procurement in Brazil, which is an amazing like creative, like cultural commons oriented space.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:26:03.280
 And also with some other people in Brazil and they were like, oh yeah, we're doing aromatic pillows. And I was like, oh, that's interesting. I would never like have thought of aromatic pillows in this area.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:19.280
 And they were like, oh yeah, and then that we take the indigenous knowledge from the people in our community of which aroma, aromatic oils are useful and we're suing a pattern that we're publishing open source later.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:38.280
 And this kind of, yeah, work was super interesting. But the, the space that I definitely would like to highlight as well is one hacker space in Togo that's just serving the one kilometer radius around the space.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 And they made it their specific mission to really include in their activities and serve with their activities, each person in this one kilometer radius, which is just an amazing concept and they're doing it through like involving people who are like collecting trash, for example, to recycle the trash.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:11.280
 And they're giving like tiny volunteer, volunteer fee amounts to the people participating in the space also sometimes if they have the potential to do that.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:32.280
 But yeah, just thinking of projects that you can just create in this one kilometer radius is super exciting. That's an ambitious mission. I think about, you know, our concept of radical inclusivity at NoiseBridge and this feels like such a radically higher bar than I think what I had envisioned at NoiseBridge.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:57.280
 And a kilometer is a lot of people there. So, yeah, also probably many people know Sa Chin Noi, who's running the salvage garden makerspace in Singapore, where during the pandemic, there was this laptop need for each child to have a laptop to be able to follow the school and like, like in many other parts of the world.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:06.280
 And so they were asking for donations for laptops to maybe give a few out, like refurbish them and give them then out, donate them to the kids in need.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:14.280
 But then they had these thousands of laptops suddenly because they're really good in like activating the community around them.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:39.280
 And then they were like making it. It was really tough because they had so many laptops. So they had a good sorting mechanism of getting all the spare parts in different kinds of shelves and many of the laptops were not in the stage of repair anymore, but they were still good salvage material where they could do something with it.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:29:08.280
 And then they started to create new things out of the spare parts that they didn't need. Like if the loudspeaker was still usable, they created like a cardboard box and together with the kids, they would solder a new loudspeaker like an external loudspeaker for the kids or take the old laptop battery and then build it together so that it's an external battery for like loading your phone or something.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:21.280
 Like all these kind of things. And so salvaging from all the spare parts they had from these thousands of laptops, they made new educational and like useful projects out of that.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.280
 And yeah, that's just something everyone can do everywhere, but it's just so nice how they did it.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:49.280
 Yeah. Yeah, thinking back, yeah, hackerspaces when there's a disaster have filled in, just stepped up to the plate and filled in with their know-how skills experience or lack thereof and learning quickly because the community is set up to be able to do that.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:30:13.280
 Back when Fukushima was first exploding, yeah, the collaboration between crash space, hackerspace in LA and Tokyo hackerspace in Tokyo created a means, the government was being very not forthcoming about what's going on and people were very worried about being radiated to death.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:20.280
 So they came up with a very inexpensive open source radiation measuring device.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.280
 And that turned into actually a company that still exists called Safecast.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:34.280
 And of course during the pandemic there were hackerspaces all over the world in the US and Europe, but also in India and all over the world.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:46.280
 And they made lots and lots of face masks, low tech stuff like that, just with textiles and also the shields.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:56.280
 And then trying to make open source versions of ventilators which were in short supply, especially at the beginning of the pandemic.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.280
 So lots of interesting things in that regard.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:08.280
 Yeah, and seeing also hackerspaces in, I don't have much experience in the Middle East.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.280
 I've been to two hackerspaces there. I was a hacker in residence in Tel Aviv.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:23.280
 That's pretty much more wealthy people, although there are a lot of people who have almost nothing who were totally welcome to make use of the resources there.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:29.280
 If you ever want to do a tour, go to Science Camp in Basra. They're doing amazing work.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.280
 I'd love to.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:40.280
 The other one I went to was through Bilal, who you know, who's part of GIG as well, Global Innovation Gathering.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:49.280
 He organized a trip to Cairo when the first Maker Faire in all of Africa happened there in 2011.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 And he found out about these three people who are starting a hackerspace in Cairo.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:03.280
 That would have been the first, at least as far as we knew, hackerspace in all of Africa who is sort of connected to the global scene anyways.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:10.280
 And we did a crowd source funding and got a bunch of money more than we needed.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.280
 So we had someone come along to document it, and that turned into some pretty interesting stuff that people can look at to learn from.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:25.280
 But we got donations from hackerspaces from Europe and the US, which people shipped to us and then we brought to Cairo.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.280
 And MakerBot donated one of their early kits in 2011.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.280
 Back in 2011, not all that long ago, even though it was kind of a long time ago for human life.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:42.280
 But 3D printers weren't really a thing yet. They were just sort of starting.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:51.280
 So these people made one, partly at their forming hackerspace and then later finished it with a huge group of people helping at the Maker Faire.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:33:05.280
 And it was really wonderful. And then seeing all of these people who found out about this because we did these hackerspace meetups where we just facilitated people who were interested in the idea of coming together in the community

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:18.280
 to explore the various things that they could benefit from hackerspaces, making a living, helping the community, using the garbage basically as resources to make all sorts of cool things.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:26.280
 That's so common. Like in Kenya, there's AB3D or something similar is the name.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:36.280
 They just took all the spare parts that were also garbage and created like e-waste and created a new 3D printer out of it.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:47.280
 And one of them he brought also to Republica one day and then was still, I think it's still in the Technik Museum, like in the Museum of Technology or somewhere in Berlin.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 Cool. We need to find that out. But also in Ghana, for example, they're doing so much. And I wouldn't call KumasiHive, for example, a hackerspace because they're full blown like a tech educational institution

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:14.280
 where they're basically also replacing parts of the tech education that is not very practical in the universities. But then they're doing it in the Hive, in the Hub.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:24.280
 So, hubs itself are so crucial. And then they created like Hub in the Box back then in Cairo, right?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:37.280
 Which is basically also a tiny bit like hackerspace design patterns, but adapted. So, yeah, we're currently recreating that with the project that we're running. So that's really cool.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:47.280
 It is cool. You know, and the thing is like in what we call developing countries, and the US is like dipping down below that level, whatever that might be.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:55.280
 But, you know, people, so many people have so little and there is so much garbage, which, you know, that's the hacker thing.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:02.280
 There's resources in the world. We can make use of them. And it doesn't have to be intended, used in the way intended.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.280
 And garbage is intended to be thrown away, whatever that means. But there's valuable stuff there that we can use.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:17.280
 And for people who have very few resources otherwise, they can make use of that. And by necessity in these places, people make use of them.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 And that's also a political issue in the sense that so much of importing is impossible.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:37.280
 So there's a lot of innovation laws that are prohibiting imports and that make it super, super hard to get the parts that are in the bill of materials or get the proper whatever machine that you want to have.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:44.280
 And so creating it yourself is, I think, the better option. We should also do it here.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:52.280
 We should. We can learn from what these people in other places in the world, maybe they're doing it from what we might call necessity.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.280
 But we can, it's important for all of us, there's so few resources that we've been digging out of the ground.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:04.280
 And we might as well make use of what's available rather than digging up new resources.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:14.280
 As the US spirals downward, there will be more and more people who probably need to do this as well. You know, just as one example of where it would be very useful.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.280
 But here in Europe...

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:23.280
 I would say even that it's even more important nowadays that resources are depleted and we need to scale down.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:41.280
 We need to have less of everything, but also less of the super high tech and create things with the least possible resource use and the least possible electricity use.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:53.280
 Be it with hardware hacking, but also in software. Writing less lines of code, as many people know, is hard, but it's also better.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:02.280
 So removing things again and making it polished is super important also for energy usage, for example.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:11.280
 And I think that's one of the things, like I think in the introduction they said, like past, present, future of hackerspaces.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:31.280
 And I think that's so much of the future of being mindful of all the good that hackers, makers can do in the world in the sense that we are like creating technology that then will at some point maybe become mainstream.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:37.280
 And that is influencing how people are seeing technology.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280
 Absolutely.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:53.280
 And also repair, for example, repair culture is so crucial and like having textiles and having other kind of more repair oriented things in the hackerspaces is so useful.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.280
 Indeed.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.280
 So many more.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:17.280
 Oh, there's so much to talk about there. But yeah, if hackerspaces could continue to exist and explore and find cool things and cool ways of looking at stuff that can be beneficial to society at large, as has already happened in lots of ways, but it can happen in so many ways.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.280
 There's lots to learn from what we've experienced in hackerspaces.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.280
 There's, especially in the Western world, but all over them in the modern world.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.280
 There's so little community, you know, functional community in our lives.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:42.280
 And we as geeks have found this one way of creating community, even if it's very broad in its in its themes.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:48.280
 And it works. It's really, really hard work, as we all know.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:53.280
 It's really hard work and sometimes it's can be even traumatic emotionally for all of us.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.280
 But, but we need it. It's so important.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:08.280
 And by what we learn, we can share that with others so that other kinds of communities can form, which are so necessary for all of us.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.280
 You know, right now the world's becoming more polarized.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:18.280
 Fascism is on the rise, which causes more polarization and people are freaking out more and more.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:26.280
 But we need community more as a result of that, even as that makes it more difficult, more challenging.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:33.280
 So we've already been through this since like 2005.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:42.280
 The hacker space has been in its same place since then as the oldest hacker space in the same place.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.280
 That's a long time now. You know, 18 years plus.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.280
 And that's a lot of experience to learn from.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:57.280
 So how do we get that information out in the world in a form that other people can easily digest and then want to digest?

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:04.280
 Because we need the fun because other aspects are so difficult and challenging, even as they're rewarding.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.280
 Well, I'd love to dive into that here.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.280
 I mean, I think that's a great transition into some of the things I'd love to discuss of, you know,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.280
 what are some of those learnings that we as a community have have, you know,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.280
 or we as individuals within these communities have learned, you know,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.280
 either firsthand or through others about how to create healthy communities,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.280
 about how to create resilient communities in the face of both, I think,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.280
 internal challenges within our communities, but also external challenges.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:43.280
 And those end up being kind of the same thing, but with very different, through different lenses anyway.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.280
 Yeah, that's very broad. But I can ask more questions to dig into it.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:55.280
 But yeah, the most obvious answer is for me always the trust building within the community.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:02.280
 It's not community if you're not having at least this kind of basic trust with each other.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.280
 And it doesn't come without work.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:13.280
 So there's a lot of work of organizing the community, of actually having the space

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.280
 and meeting in the space without just sitting next to each other and only looking into the computer,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.280
 which is important as well. I mean, that's also why we found these spaces, right?

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.280
 But to have events together, to organize events together, to have cooking parties,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.280
 to have like all these different kinds of activities that make you talk to each other

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:42.280
 and that help you to really connect also on this kind of personal level,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:48.280
 which is usually the case. Like people who are part of the same space are usually also like friends

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:54.280
 with each other at some point, or at least partially.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.280
 And this kind of trust works on all levels. Like it works in our global community

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.280
 because we meet like at least once a year with at least part of the people.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:10.280
 And like the pandemic showed that it's super difficult to recreate this online.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:19.280
 So of course everybody did and tried, but there were so many spaces that were like really having a hard time

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:31.280
 and only like rebooting very slowly to normal levels of connection and trust and activity thereof.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:36.280
 And yeah, I think that's just the most important part.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:44.280
 And that's why I'm part of a housing community now where we meet each month for one weekend

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.280
 to create community together even before we are living together.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:55.280
 And that's a lot of work as well. And I'm learning so many techniques that housing communities use

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:02.280
 and that other kinds of communities use that I didn't know from our community yet,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:08.280
 which is super exciting, like these very deep conversations you have with someone.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:13.280
 What are some examples of what's working in the housing community that you don't see in the hackerspace community?

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.280
 I like this kind of openness for these methodologies.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:29.280
 Like we have, for example, we look at Scott Pack and the community building patterns that he's working with

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:41.280
 and even kind of something like communication that communicates needs and wishes more from the eye perspective,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.280
 which is also super crucial. Like how do we talk to each other in a community?

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:55.280
 Do we criticize a person immediately for doing something if they are active?

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.280
 And we say "Wer macht hat recht", so who's doing something is on the right side,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.280
 but that's maybe not always possible and not always right actually.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:13.280
 So that's creating a lot of conflicts also because the person who's doing something

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:19.280
 needs to also speak with the others sometimes or most of the times.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:28.280
 But then also things like just sitting with one other person and really listening to what they're saying

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.280
 and then speaking yourself and what you're saying.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.280
 I think I was often regarding these kind of techniques as something,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.280
 "Oh, we don't need this, we're functioning", right?

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:47.280
 But no, it's really useful to learn these kind of things.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.280
 Effective communication strategies.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.280
 I mean there's science behind it, right?

00:44:52.280 --> 00:45:00.280
 So there's lots of neurobiology, social science, social psychology,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.280
 and all these things that you can study and you can be a nerd in.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:09.280
 And then you can share this knowledge again in your hacker space, so that's super cool.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.280
 But other people need to be kind of a tiny bit open for that.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:21.280
 You also need to have a discussion in your space around your patterns of how you work together

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:31.280
 and how you be together and some kind of openness for also learning these kind of things.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.280
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.280
 Nerds tend to not...

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:41.280
 Yeah, and I think there is, you touched on there can be this kind of resistance

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.280
 to what some people view as too squishy.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:50.280
 That's for other people to talk about.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.280
 That's for psychology majors or whatever.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:06.280
 And I think that we as a hacker space commuter desperately need that knowledge and that practice.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:15.280
 I think it's part of the work that we did together at NoiseBridge was really trying to help catalyze some discussions

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.280
 about how do we have difficult conversations?

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:27.280
 What frameworks can we use for talking about sensitive topics, about difficult topics?

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.280
 It was definitely a learning process, often a hard-fought learning process.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:40.280
 I joined NoiseBridge shortly before the great reboot, which was a time around Occupy Wall Street

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:49.280
 where through NoiseBridge's collaboration with Occupy Wall Street and supporting them,

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:58.280
 it led to a bunch of people coming into the space who really saw NoiseBridge as a place to have a roof over their head

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:04.280
 and cook food in the kitchen and maybe play video games and do drugs in the bathroom.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:17.280
 And that led to a decline in the community where it was a negative feedback loop where more...

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:25.280
 The NoiseBridge community that had preceded that, many people said, "I don't want to be part of this environment.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.280
 This is an uncomfortable environment for me to be in. This isn't the reason I come to NoiseBridge."

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:37.280
 And at the same time made it a more and more comfortable environment for people who did want to do those things.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:43.280
 The space went through a decline and rebirth that we dubbed the NoiseBridge reboot.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:50.280
 So I think we ended up having to really figure out how are we as a community going to learn from this?

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.280
 And one of the, I think, hard things was figuring out, okay, how do we talk about these topics?

00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.280
 How do we talk about these topics in a way in which it's effective,

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:09.280
 that we're not immediately diving into a very heated conflict about something?

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:16.280
 And I think also defining who do we want to have as part of our community?

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:27.280
 How do we, you know, I think NoiseBridge from its inception had a very strong ethic of radical inclusivity, right?

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:35.280
 That was always a key point of being very open and inclusive to whoever wanted to be there.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.280
 And I think we really had to face, what does that mean?

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:46.280
 And are there people maybe we do want to exclude or are there types of behaviors we want to exclude?

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:54.280
 And I think the hackerspace patterns touches on that, but I think we learned in a much deeper way, how do we need to wrestle with that?

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.280
 Yeah, especially in the United States and especially in San Francisco,

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.280
 which is getting worse in this regard all the time because there's no social safety net

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.280
 and there's no services for people who can really benefit from them.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:17.280
 And there are a lot of very hurting people out on the street who have no way to take care of themselves.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.280
 And many of these people are mentally ill, many are drug addicted.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:28.280
 There are some resources in San Francisco available for this and not enough.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.280
 So some people tried to fill in that void by coming to NoiseBridge.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:40.280
 And NoiseBridge just is not a space that exists for those particular social ills.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:50.280
 And as heart wrenchingly difficult as it was, asking people who are there who really don't belong,

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.280
 who aren't there for the values and the activities of NoiseBridge,

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.280
 I became really good at sort of playing the bad guy.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:04.280
 But respectfully following NoiseBridge's one and only one rule, which is be excellent to each other,

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:10.280
 respectfully showing people, we actually printed up lists of resources,

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.280
 like this isn't really the place that's appropriate for this,

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.280
 but these people can help you check this out and even sometimes taking them there.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:25.280
 And some people though were violent and they just had to be told to leave and not come back.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:33.280
 And just coming up with a scheme moving forward, the reboot was shutting the whole thing down.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.280
 Because it was full of garbage, there were five tons of broken useless things that we had to get rid of.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.280
 And I know that because we had to weigh it in order to bring it to the dump.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.280
 Such a waste of stuff.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:53.280
 And then shutting it down, only people for six months who were building up and reorganizing,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.280
 cleaning up, fixing up, talking about how to move forward were there.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:04.280
 And then we opened up slowly and then rapidly and within a year it was back to a thriving community again,

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:08.280
 which was such magic and we had no idea if it would work.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.280
 It was our last desperate attempt. We called it the reboot.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.280
 If your operating system doesn't work, turn it off and on again.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.280
 So that worked.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:23.280
 And so what we learned through that experience is some hackerspaces,

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.280
 from talking to people around the world, I've been to hundreds of hackerspaces,

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:32.280
 and they're all different and different organizations, different visions and missions.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.280
 Some of them will not exclude anybody.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.280
 And they see that as their mission because if you exclude someone, they have no chance of benefiting from you.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.280
 So these people are willing to put that time and effort into every single person.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:52.280
 But for a place like Noisebridge that proved to be too draining,

00:51:52.280 --> 00:52:03.280
 people, once it's too draining, people have to be shown that the community as a whole is hurting too much from this individual's process.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:10.280
 And again, I could play the bad guy and respectfully show people that there are better places for them.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.280
 And wow, that's so difficult and it never gets easy.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:23.280
 But we saw that what happened slowly is kind of like you were saying, through the pandemic,

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.280
 people would lose track just by seeing each other on a screen.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:36.280
 Things would slide and there'd be less connection and therefore a bit less trust and a bit less knowing.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:43.280
 And as more and more new people come, more and more of those people knew less and less about what Noisebridge really was about.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:52.280
 And so the message for new people wasn't communicated after them as effectively about what Noisebridge is about.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:57.280
 And so people had these diffusing, more diffuse and more diffuse notions.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:04.280
 And so what we decided after the reboot was we won't have the door open all the time.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.280
 There were thousands and thousands of keys for the door.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.280
 So it didn't matter if it was open or not anyways. And I gave away about a thousand or two thousand myself.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.280
 And other people made copies. And that was by design.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.280
 But after that, the door was locked. And anyone, though, could ring the doorbell at any time.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:28.280
 And if you let someone in, and that was encouraged, you didn't have to, but if you let someone in,

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:33.280
 then it was your personal responsibility to give them a tour, the new person.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:41.280
 And if they seemed to be sketchy or violent or like they wanted to steal stuff, they're checking the piece out.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.280
 Or if they're saying, I know the owner here.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.280
 There's no owner here. It's a panic cassette.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.280
 An immediate red flag.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.280
 And then we came up with the notion of red flag. So red flag didn't mean a person wasn't appropriate.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.280
 It just meant, let's keep an eye on this and talk about it with each other and let them know, too, that, you know,

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.280
 we're looking out for each other and you're part of this whole thing, too.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.280
 And like these behaviors can change if you want to stay here. Cool.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.280
 You know, just fit in a little better.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:15.280
 But anyways, people are given a tour. What Noisemakers is about, it's about community, not the tools.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.280
 And we're anarchist, hacker space. There's no leaders. Doocracy.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:25.280
 Just do it, but be excellent when you do it and be ready to undo it if people object, if you...

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.280
 And et cetera, et cetera.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:34.280
 So then that new person, if they want to, the next time someone rings the doorbell,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.280
 two minutes later, they can give a tour in their own words.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.280
 And that reinforces in them.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.280
 And so now everyone coming in has a notion of what they're getting involved with.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.280
 And if it's something they want to keep being involved with, and many did, some became super involved.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:55:00.280
 And yeah, but there is this notion very much that there are some people that unfortunately, for many people,

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.280
 they're just not a good match for this particular community.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.280
 Or not at that point in time. Right?

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:12.280
 We had people in our community who, you know, either started out as not a good fit or started out as a good fit

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:16.280
 and became not a good fit. And some people went through that cycle multiple times.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:24.280
 That's true. And some people who were very problematic after seeing...

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:30.280
 Like they didn't want people to not like them. They weren't like psychopaths or whatever.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:37.280
 And so just seeing that there was problematic behavior as people, various individuals in the community saw,

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:44.280
 and just individuals one on one talking, the person was like, "Yeah, you know, I don't want to have these patterns continue."

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:51.280
 And there's a few people I can think of who became really wonderful members of the community just because of that kind of talk.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:56:01.280
 And a lot of people at NoiseBridge had been through training, like official training even, for nonviolent communication is one form,

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.280
 I think, of what you were talking about earlier.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.280
 Yeah, I didn't come up with a name.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:14.280
 And so there's a lot of really great tools for how to talk with people who might otherwise be very untrusting

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.280
 and there'd be a chance of extreme friction.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:26.280
 But you can... A lot of tools for getting people to feel more open as you become more vulnerable slowly

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.280
 so that you don't get attacked as well.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:37.280
 And it opens up communications channels to make possible things that seem almost impossible otherwise.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:45.280
 Even on a country level like Ireland voting for a vast majority for abortion rights.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.280
 Who would have thought that? Not even all that many years ago.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.280
 And if a whole country can do that, certainly a hackerspace can do that.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:02.280
 It gets more challenging when there's housing involved because that's a basic human need.

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:08.280
 And when people feel a basic need being threatened, people usually don't behave at their best.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.280
 But that doesn't mean it's not possible.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:20.280
 And as you're experiencing it sounds not only possible but wonderful even going through the challenges that are difficult.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:27.280
 I wanted to touch on inclusivity and accessibility of hackerspaces.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:32.280
 I think... And maybe a starting point is why.

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:39.280
 Like why make... You know, if you're making a new hackerspace with a few of your friends,

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.280
 why consider making it more inclusive and more accessible to others?

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:52.280
 What are the... Sort of selfishly, what are the benefits to having an inclusive and open hackerspace?

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:56.280
 Because we've certainly touched on some of the problems.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.280
 I think most of the problems come from not having an inclusive space.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:07.280
 Like not having a diverse space is bringing so many problems because you're not seeing all the perspectives.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:16.280
 Like if you're talking, for example, about being inclusive for age, if you're collaborating with schools,

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:27.280
 if you're collaborating with senior citizens, there's so many interesting and very inspiring parts of life that you can get as a result.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.280
 Many people in a hackerspace would identify maybe as I don't have so much to do with kids

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:40.280
 or I don't have to do so much with elderly people because I don't live in my village anymore or in my small city

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.280
 where my parents live and where my grandparents live.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:52.280
 And so having this kind of age diversity, for example, brings in this human need of connection

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.280
 also with different kinds of life stages, I would say.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.280
 So that's super interesting.

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.280
 Diversity of ideas and approaches.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.280
 Yeah, totally. And also of knowledge.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:09.280
 Like I can learn so much from a younger person or an older person, for example.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:15.280
 And yeah, I think that's just so good.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.280
 And I mean, why would you want to have more people in the space?

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.280
 It's usually also that you want to sustain the space in some way that it runs longer

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:34.280
 because not every person who's starting the space or who's currently running the space will be available in 10 years from now.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280
 I think that's a great point.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.280
 And if you want to then come back to the space, like I'm a member of C-Base and I was active many years ago,

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:50.280
 more than I am now, but if I come back a few times a year or more than that,

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:56.280
 then I can always see what's happening and I can always use the space still.

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.280
 I can still run an event there or something like that.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:10.280
 I think we as hackers and geeks tend to think about when we're designing systems, we think of them as static.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:18.280
 We think if only I come up with the perfect design and I do it perfect and I polish it just right,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.280
 it will never need to be touched again.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.280
 And I think we do the same thing when we're designing our communities.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:31.280
 Often we have the tendency to say, okay, based on the group that I start with,

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:40.280
 if I make the perfect community around these people, then it will be self-sustaining and it will last forever.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:49.280
 And we forget to acknowledge that people's lives change, that people move, people get new jobs,

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:57.280
 people have families, and their involvement with the community shifts over time and that inherently changes the community.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:08.280
 And so I think maybe one of the things that we can talk about is this idea of planning for change,

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.280
 planning for things to shift over time.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:16.280
 And I think an inherent part of that is you constantly need new people coming into your community

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.280
 if your community is going to stay healthy and sustain itself.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.280
 That's one of the design patterns from 2007-8.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.280
 Interesting. I didn't realize that was in there.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.280
 And they explicitly say younger people, but I don't think it necessarily has to be younger people.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.280
 I think it's good that it's younger people.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.280
 But new people, and this is why San Francisco is now dead.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.280
 New people have come in, but they're not really there because they're working all the time

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.280
 to just make enough money to pay for rent and food and expenses.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.280
 So new energy is not being put into community there.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.280
 And so things have devolved.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.280
 The only things that are there are things that are still there, like Noise Bridge and a bunch of other things,

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.280
 that are coming from older people rather than new people starting new things.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.280
 And the same thing in hackerspace is we must have a constant influx of people,

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.280
 and the more diverse, I think, the better.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.280
 And of course we don't want Nazis coming in.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.280
 We have limits on our diversity.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.280
 You have to have good patterns.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280
 Good code of conduct.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.280
 People who fit into our values, and the values need to be explicitly articulated.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.280
 So a vision, a mission, people coming in have to know what they're becoming a part of.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:43.280
 And to be aware that there are now trolls in the world who totally love mucking things up purposefully just because they can.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.280
 And this is becoming more problematic now.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:54.280
 So how do you get rid of people who are really masterful at weaseling their way in and gratiating themselves

01:02:54.280 --> 01:03:00.280
 even over a period of years and then revealing that what they really wanted was power in this situation?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.280
 Or who knows what?

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.280
 And there are governments around the world with powerful people who feel threatened by communities they don't have control over,

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:16.280
 and some governments pay people to do this or encourage them by getting them, "You're in trouble, boy,

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:23.280
 but maybe if you do a couple things for us you could be a little less trouble. Maybe. Let's see what you do."

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.280
 Whatever, I'm just making this up off the top of my head. I don't know.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:35.280
 But it would really surprise me if there weren't, for example, in Noisbridge people who were there because they were told to be there,

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.280
 whether they're paid or not.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.280
 But my point of view is it almost doesn't matter.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.280
 If they learn some cool things that they take forward in the rest of their life, wonderful.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.280
 They're human as well.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:57.280
 But their role as an agent, which we have to look out for because that can be harmful to the functional, healthy community.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.280
 And same, you know, of course, here there's people who are told to come here to chaos camp or chaos congress,

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.280
 just like DEFCON, probably even more so there, but who knows?

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:19.280
 So, yeah, having a diversity of people who fit in with the community, who will help it grow and evolve and change over time

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.280
 in a manageable way that's good for the community.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.280
 And for that, I think the more diverse the better.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:34.280
 Yeah, we were just running a research project around this in critical making where we just published some tiny handbook

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:42.280
 based also on the experience of some people there, like how to create the more inclusive space.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.280
 Like what do you need to have good patterns?

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.280
 Maybe we should add it to the hacker space design patterns at some point.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:58.280
 Of what you should communicate, for example, like have on your website that your wheelchair accessible or not.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:03.280
 If the toilet, for example, is not wheelchair accessible, that's not always a problem.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:09.280
 But you just need to communicate it before and maybe have like a partnership with a nearby shop or nearby restaurant

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.280
 where people can go to the bathroom and like be just aware of these things.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:20.280
 And just having this checklist hopefully helps some people to be more aware of some parts of what they don't do at the moment.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.280
 Or maybe they find, oh, I do something different that is not there yet.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.280
 So hopefully they contribute.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:39.280
 But yeah, just I think this kind of process for new people that you described for like having some kind of buddy or mentor for the new ones is so helpful.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:48.280
 Also to see who are actually fitting in and who are not and seeing like which ones of those that currently don't fit in.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.280
 Do we want to have anyway?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:06:03.280
 Like who of those who don't have really much time, which is often like also an issue, who maybe don't have money to contribute to the membership fee or something like these things.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.280
 It's always good to reflect on how can we do things differently.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:16.280
 Like many of the hacker spaces nowadays have this kind of model where you can choose what you pay from like even zero euros to be a member of the space.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.280
 That's what we did with Ridge.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.280
 There was no monetary requirement for any amount of participation in the space.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.280
 And then just to publish, hey, in the month we need so and so much money to cover our rent and costs.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:41.280
 And in the end it evens out because some people will have the means to contribute more and they see, oh, we are like not making the full amount that we need each month.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:48.280
 And so then they can give a little bit more and others without shame can say, hey, I'm currently running really low on money.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.280
 I'm just giving one euro a month.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.280
 And that's so cool just as a concept.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.280
 And money is only one way to contribute to the community and the space.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.280
 There are many other valuable ways to contribute.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:06.280
 Let's talk a little bit about sort of inclusivity.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:20.280
 I think there are a lot of people out there probably watching right now who have had or are having an experience that I had when I first came into the community,

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:26.280
 which is that they're intrigued about hacker spaces, but they're also intimidated by them.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:36.280
 I think when I first heard about NoiseBridge, I was very intimidated of is this a place that I belong?

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280
 How are people going to react to me there?

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.280
 Can I really just show up and ring the doorbell?

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.280
 What's that going to be like?

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.280
 And that experience lasted for a long time.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:55.280
 That experience of feeling like an outsider and feeling like maybe I shouldn't be there and maybe I didn't belong there lasted for six or 12 months.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:06.280
 And I've heard that from a bunch of people of sort of feeling like maybe this isn't for me, maybe I'm an outsider, maybe this is an in-club,

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.280
 maybe this is not a safe place for me to be, maybe this is not an accessible place to be.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:21.280
 I think I would ask both of you, what would you say to someone like that who had yet to visit a hacker space?

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:31.280
 And then I'm going to ask you again, what would you say to someone who said that who had been to a hacker space, been to the same hacker space ten times?

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280
 Want to start?

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280
 Sure.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.280
 You know, we all have imposter syndrome, right?

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280
 All of us.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.280
 No matter how accomplished we've been in our lives or how little accomplished we've been in our lives,

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:51.280
 we all think like, oh yeah, all these other people have done this stuff, but I've only taught 100,000 people how to solve it.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.280
 But I still suffer from this.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280
 Me too.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280
 How can we not?

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.280
 But we grew up, most of us, as introverted geeks.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:12.280
 And it was probably worse being the oldest here, growing up as a kid as a geek, being beaten up every day for being queer as well,

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.280
 but being an introverted geek as well.

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.280
 And yeah, it's difficult.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.280
 And then being part of a group, for me that meant getting beaten up in school while the teachers...

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.280
 Yeah, that was not a familiar experience for me.

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280
 And then...

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.280
 Being part of any in-group was a foreign experience.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.280
 No, I mean, we are not the cool kids, right?

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:40.280
 And so going to a place where you see people getting along and it seems safe, but is it really safe?

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.280
 Can we really trust this?

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.280
 No, yeah, maybe, I don't know.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:51.280
 And going to my first hacker conference and no one even teased me.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.280
 It's just like, what the...

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280
 Is this real?

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280
 What's going on?

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:07.280
 And then going to the first CCC event for me, 23C3, it was even more warm and welcoming.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:17.280
 And these people know so much about internet security, the things I knew back then nothing about.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.280
 And the hardware people I met knew way more than me about so much.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.280
 And yet people were wanting me to share what I know.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:32.280
 And then these people sharing with me felt so wonderful.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.280
 But yeah, it takes time.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.280
 We bring ourselves with us wherever we go, of course, right?

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:48.280
 And even if things feel really wonderful, those patterns from, for me, decades, aren't going to go away really quickly.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:58.280
 But the one thing that I would tell myself as I'm going to more and more of these events and then starting NoiseBridge eventually with other people is...

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:06.280
 You know, I've been through all this stuff and it really is just a bunch of introverted geeks.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:10.280
 And everyone has imposter syndrome.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.280
 And we all go through it in our each individual unique ways.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:24.280
 But that's what I share with people when I talk about, you know, like if I meet someone who's at all geeky in whatever realm, this camp, it's my favorite event.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:31.280
 You might really like it and it's worth spending the money and going way out of your way, whatever you need to do to go there.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:38.280
 And same with going to hackerspaces or whatever events that they seem interested in.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.280
 Go and sit with that uncomfortable feeling.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:51.280
 But the first camp that I went to, 2007, like everyone's having this great time from my perspective and I'm just like, "Oh, this isn't for me. Why am I here?"

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.280
 But something always clicks.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.280
 And then I go from being an observer to a participant.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.280
 And that transition happened every time.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:12.280
 It took a while every time because of my sort of unconscious reluctance to feel trustful and okay in a group.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:19.280
 You know, and I still have that in many ways, but I have now so much experience where it just always works out.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.280
 I just have to trust that it will and it does.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.280
 And I share that with other people as well.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.280
 So that's what I do.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280
 Yeah.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:39.280
 Yeah, I think for me it was mostly being connected online already to so many people, like from, I don't know, 2007 to 2010.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.280
 And how did you get connected to them initially?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.280
 Like just following people, like back then on Twitter, but nowadays I would do it on Macedon, of course.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:59.280
 And to find nice people that I was interacting with, like writing each other, like answering, and all these kind of things.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.280
 And then I was already feeling like we know each other when I met people.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:14.280
 And so when I now meet someone that I follow in Macedon and that I have conversations with, then I can like, "Oh, hey, I'm this one."

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.280
 We know each other from the Internet and we see each other soon on the Internet again.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.280
 So you don't feel like it's a totally cold interaction.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280
 Yeah, totally.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:28.280
 And it's so much easier for me to just write a short text instead of like, "Hey, Mitch, how are you?"

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.280
 Yeah.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.280
 So that's so much easier for me.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:43.280
 And then also being active, like you said, participant, and that's like organized participation in your hackerspace, I would say, is something to really do.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:51.280
 Like here, you would be an angel and it's your first CCC event, but you can still be like immediately active.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.280
 Which are the volunteers here that help run the camp.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.280
 Yeah, volunteers are called angels.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:04.280
 And when I was at my first Congress 2010, I was also immediately like registering as an angel because that's what you do.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:10.280
 And then you do like, I don't know, bottle collection shifts or whatever other shift is available.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.280
 And you meet people, you do something together.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.280
 That's super important.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.280
 And I think that's also possible in any like hackerspace.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:27.280
 That's also done in most of the hackerspaces, I would say, that you can have like events where you do something together with people.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:34.280
 You have this kind of open days where people can come and they could try out something like Solider for five minutes.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:44.280
 That's what I was going to add on to that is Mitch for a very long time ran Circuit Hacking Mondays where every Monday night he would teach people to solder.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:52.280
 And I think that was the event that I started once I became fully comfortable at NoiseBridge and felt a part of it.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.280
 And people would ask me, how can I get involved in NoiseBridge?

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:03.280
 One of my suggestions was go to Circuit Hacking Mondays because it was an organized event at a specific time, regardless of where I was in the world.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280
 Regular?

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.280
 Who I was sending there.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.280
 I knew that it would happen, right?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.280
 Even if Mitch wasn't in town, somebody else would run it.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.280
 It would always happen.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.280
 And it was, it had enough structure to it that it started at a specific time.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280
 There was a specific activity.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280
 Somebody led it.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.280
 As open as NoiseBridge is, I think its openness can be intimidating as well.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:38.280
 And so having more of a set time and a set destination and some structure to it gives you, gives someone who doesn't know how the community works a set role to play.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:49.280
 So that they kind of know what they're supposed to do for their first, and then they can sit in the space for a couple hours and see how other people are interacting with each other and use that as an on-ramp.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.280
 And see the sewing next door.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.280
 Exactly.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:56.280
 And then the cleaning over there, the bio stuff over there, and get, "Oh, I should come back."

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.280
 Yeah, and then you would have people leading these workshops in a diverse set of people.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:14.280
 So you would have all different kinds of workshops maybe that are run so that it's representative of who you want to attract.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280
 Yes.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.280
 Because it's easier to come back again and be less intimidated.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:29.280
 For me, for example, if a workshop is led by a woman, then it's easier for me to join it and to be more open for it.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.280
 And it's the same if you're running something for young people.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:41.280
 It's maybe easier if it's a younger person running it, or running it together with somebody else.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.280
 You can see someone like you in the space.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280
 Yeah.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.280
 So you're coming back more easier.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280
 Yeah.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:57.280
 And I think also, and that would be the less tiny contribution, but a bigger one, making something that makes sense in the space.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:08.280
 Contributing something to the community, creating something that is helping your surroundings, but also in the more general sense.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:16.280
 Like there's humanitarian hacking with CADOS here in Berlin, but probably also with many other organizations.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.280
 You can create, for example, humanitarian aid equipment.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:28.280
 You have something where we really have a project that is making a difference in the world.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:38.280
 Where you can then see, oh, the thing that I soldered helps someone else to be like...

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.280
 I wanted to touch on codes of conduct.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.280
 It was something that you and I mentioned when we were talking earlier today.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:50.280
 And I know, Mitch, you've been involved in creating codes of conduct and discussions around that.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:59.280
 I guess I was thinking about it in the context of, you know, we were talking about communication earlier in the context of accessibility.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.280
 And that doing work to make your space accessible is important.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:09.280
 But it doesn't end there.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.280
 It's important, but it's not actually always necessary to do all of the accessibility things.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:23.280
 The more important thing is to communicate what does exist so that when people are considering going to a hackerspace,

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.280
 that they know what to expect and know based on their needs.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:32.280
 And I think maybe code of conduct falls into a similar category in terms of being inclusive,

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:39.280
 is that it helps to signal to people what kind of space should I expect, you know,

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:46.280
 and what should I expect is considered acceptable behavior and what's unacceptable,

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.280
 and what kind of level of safety can I expect out of a space.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.280
 Totally. And you don't even need to label it code of conduct if you don't like it.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.280
 That's part of your culture in the hackerspace.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:02.280
 You can also say, like, this is how we are excellent to each other, and this is how we act as a team.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:12.280
 It's not obvious for everyone. Sometimes in a space for science education kids,

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.280
 they are writing guidelines for parents on the wall.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.280
 Oh, your mic. So maybe repeat what you just said.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:33.280
 Sometimes in this tiny science education space where they put guidelines for the parents on the wall

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:44.280
 where don't tell your kid what they are doing there, don't explain to the kid what they are just currently experimenting with,

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.280
 but let them explore themselves. And that's such an important rule,

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:53.280
 and it's not so obvious because as parents you always explain things.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:58.280
 And I think also as the person who knows something, also in a hackerspace, you often explain things,

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:05.280
 and maybe, yeah, you asked before, and this is something that you can write in your code of conduct

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.280
 or in your guidelines, like, ask people before you want to explain something,

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.280
 because that feels so much more comfortable.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.280
 And then people are really happy to hear the explanation, right?

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.280
 Yeah, as I see it, code of conduct or whatever it would be called,

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:30.280
 having an awareness team is more the common way to saying it now,

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:36.280
 is really a part of conflict resolution as I see it, as well as having, just saying that you have,

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:44.280
 you're welcoming to all of these people, no matter who you are, race, gender, etc., etc., etc.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.280
 Everyone's welcome, and just saying that is a really good thing,

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.280
 because then someone who's like, "Oh, I've always been an outsider,

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:57.280
 and I've been beaten up for being queer, trans, whatever,"

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.280
 knowing that this place is explicitly saying it, "I belong there," is really helpful.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:13.280
 So from my experience, the more minimal a code of conduct or whatever to call it,

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.280
 the more minimal it is, the better.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:23.280
 And have it be so that everyone should be encouraged, if possible,

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.280
 and it's not always possible because of lots of different reasons,

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.280
 to work things out one-on-one, if possible,

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.280
 and if not, to have people who volunteer to be mediators

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.280
 and have a bunch of people, if possible, so that everyone involved

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:44.280
 can know that someone that they think they can trust is listening to them,

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.280
 so that they know they're being heard.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.280
 And that's the hugest part of conflict resolution,

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.280
 that each person feels heard, listened to, respected,

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:04.280
 and from there, having some maybe not totally explicit,

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.280
 depends on the organization.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.280
 Like at Noisebridge, we found that if we were very explicit,

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.280
 that there would be people who would do what we called "lawyering,"

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.280
 you know, gaming the rules, just to get their way,

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.280
 and that drains so much energy from the community.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:28.280
 So we had a more anarchist approach, case by case,

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:34.280
 as problems arose and many problems arise in any community,

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:39.280
 and just coming up with creative ways, sometimes involving that person directly,

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.280
 sometimes more like through a mediator,

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.280
 we would rarely bring people in conflict who couldn't work things out one-on-one together,

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.280
 sometimes with the consent of both that seemed appropriate,

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.280
 but anyways, there's all these different possibilities,

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.280
 and doing things case by case, we found at Noisebridge,

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.280
 with that particular kind of community, to be the best approach.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:08.280
 But just having the COC, or whatever to call it, as part of conflict resolution,

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.280
 I think is the main thing, because we need conflict resolution,

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.280
 and you have to think about that before there's a conflict,

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.280
 otherwise you're just dealing with crisis after crisis.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.280
 Oh yes, but I think it's important to really discuss these kind of guidelines,

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.280
 this kind of code of conducts with the whole community in some way,

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.280
 because it doesn't help if you just copy a code of conduct from some other place,

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.280
 and then you just impose it, and you write it somewhere.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.280
 And it's not a one-size-fits-all.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.280
 Again, it's that there's no perfect design here, it really has to be specific to the community.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:49.280
 And I think one of the things that I learned through my involvement with Noisebridge is that

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.280
 a really key part of a code of conduct,

01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:01.280
 or we had our one rule, be excellent to each other at Noisebridge,

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.280
 was that it is important for that to be a dialogue,

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.280
 and an ongoing dialogue that lasts the entire lifetime of the community.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:17.280
 That when Noisebridge had its most unhealthy moments was often when that dialogue stopped

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:23.280
 or was blocked in some way, that actually having the discussion over and over and over again

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.280
 of what are our values, how does this match our values, how do we interpret our values,

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:37.280
 was the key piece, having that discussion constantly asking ourselves over and over again,

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.280
 rather than viewing it as a design problem that can be solved once up front and then never touched again.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.280
 Yeah, this is critical.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:52.280
 So there's this one concept that might be appropriate to bring up here.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:25:01.280
 So I started a commune in 1993 in rural America, and I learned so much from that,

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:08.280
 and I learned from trauma, not from joy.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:15.280
 But I learned, and so much of my community organizing since then is from what I learned there.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.280
 There were three key takeaways from that experience.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:27.280
 The initial group of people who start a community should choose themselves explicitly,

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.280
 meaning it's not just three or four or whatever random people who happen to have the time.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.280
 It's fine if they're random people and they talk about it and they realize,

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.280
 "Oh, we do jive and this is really good," and then they can choose to be the people who start it.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.280
 That's a really important starting point.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:51.280
 Because otherwise there's going to be all these conflicts and resentments that build up,

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:57.280
 and then it's going to be really difficult sooner rather than later.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:05.280
 The other thing is to explicitly have a means for rejecting and accepting new people

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.280
 and how to do conflict resolution and, unfortunately, part of any community,

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.280
 almost any community, to kick out people who just aren't working out for whatever reasons

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.280
 and have all that be explicit.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:24.280
 So that's key things, and both of those were fatal flaws in the commune I started.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.280
 Those weren't there.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.280
 The third one is a little bit more difficult to explain, but it's so important.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:39.280
 All cultures have built into them, all communities have built into them checks and balances

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:46.280
 that encourage just automatically, subconsciously, with the way the culture is.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.280
 They encourage what the community thinks is good in people

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.280
 and discourage what they think are bad in people.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.280
 And we're all, you, me, all of us, are capable of all sorts of goods and bads

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.280
 given the wrong circumstances and the right circumstances.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:06.280
 So what do we do to encourage what we believe collectively is the best and good

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.280
 and discourage what we feel is not so good or terrible?

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:17.280
 And at Noisebridge, we're a bunch of, like I mentioned earlier, anarchists, hippie, punk, weirdo, queer, whatever, people,

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.280
 and we wanted no leaders except when appropriate and dissolve,

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:30.280
 when whatever the project goes away or whatever, anarchists with as few rules as possible.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.280
 And so after talking about all this and with all of our talks, every Tuesday meeting,

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.280
 every week for a year before we got our first space, forming a really strong culture,

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:47.280
 we came up with this brilliant idea of having one and only one rule that is subjective.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.280
 And because it's subjective, what does it mean?

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.280
 We are required to continually have an ongoing conversation about it.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.280
 And that is our checks and balances.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.280
 So, you know, like, you took that pile of resistors that had been sitting there for a month

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.280
 and put them all in bins in the right place. That is incredibly excellent. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:14.280
 You know, like, last night you made this incredibly yummy food. Thank you for that. That was excellent.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:21.280
 But no one cleaned up. And the rats came again. And the noise rats.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:28.280
 And that kind of wasn't excellent. So, you know, can you ask for help for cleaning or whatever?

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.280
 You know, and you have to be excellent when you're talking about what's excellent and what isn't.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:37.280
 But it's an ongoing evolving, slowly evolving what this one rule actually means.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.280
 And this checks and balances worked for NoiseBridge. And that's not necessarily good,

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.280
 that particular one, for all hackerspaces by any means.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:53.280
 And it's not easy to come up with artificially starting a group, how do you build in the checks and balances.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.280
 But they are there. Like, it's not socially acceptable for me to go out here after we're done

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.280
 and scream at someone just because they walked in front of me or something. Right?

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.280
 It happens just in the workshop. I just had some, there were two people yelling at each other.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.280
 I had to step in and I actually had to yell at someone to stop yelling.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:20.280
 And it worked out. And after we had a great workshop. But because it's not socially acceptable, it's built into this culture.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:26.280
 I lived in Boston where it is culturally acceptable and encouraged for people to yell at each other on the sidewalk.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.280
 And it happens as a result. Right? So, but whatever. How do you build that in?

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.280
 And there's no easy answer. And there's no one size fits all.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:43.280
 But it's really, really important to build a resilient culture that can persist and overcome even serious problems.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.280
 I think that's actually the topic I'd like to close on here.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.280
 We've touched on several times throughout this conversation is this idea of resiliency.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:58.280
 How do we build resilient communities? And Mitch, I think you talked a little bit earlier

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:04.280
 that we live in a really challenging time for building and maintaining resilient communities.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:12.280
 You know, we have a rise of fascism. We have an increasingly polarized political landscape and culture.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:24.280
 What are you both seeing that's working and not working in terms of building more resilient communities in, say, in the past five years?

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.280
 Right? Because I think things are rapidly changing in this regard.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:41.280
 Well, that's just such a big question. And so I think we touched upon quite a few parts that also help a community become more resilient.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:48.280
 And I think I would repeat the trust of the trust answer, because I think that's super crucial.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:53.280
 Which seems to paraphrase what I heard you say earlier, correct me if I heard this wrong,

01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:02.280
 but it really seems like that's rooted in building personal relationships within the community and using those as the foundation for trust. Is that?

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:07.280
 Yeah, I think so. And also doing something together like shared experience.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:15.280
 That's also crucial. But also having a goal together. I think that's also very, very helpful.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:27.280
 And talking about that. What is the mission? What are you creating together that then brings the right people also into the community?

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:39.280
 Because if you're going for a goal, then there's more drive. So creating this kind of camp here, that's a big effort that people bring together.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.280
 And I think that's something you can circle back to in the toughest of times and the hardest of conflicts to say,

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:50.280
 "Well, we may disagree and we may be at odds right now and this may feel very black and white,

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.280
 but at the end of the day we both have this shared underlying goal, this shared underlying mission."

01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:07.280
 Yeah, and the values also. If the values are in line and if people are about this kind of open culture or about the duocracy or about these kind of things,

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:14.280
 if this doesn't match my values, then I'm less inclined to actually talk to each other.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:28.280
 Yeah, you know, one sort of way that I've thought about things a lot in various groups I've been a part of and many I've left as well is personally,

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:35.280
 I have to feel sort of metaphysically that I'm getting more out, more energy out than I put in.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:46.280
 And so that has to be the case if it's going to work for me. But it's required that everyone involved is feeling that way.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:52.280
 Because if I'm the only one feeling that way or if there's a whole bunch of people who are feeling like they're going to be burning out

01:32:52.280 --> 01:33:02.280
 and I don't feel good benefiting from their burning out, I want everyone in an organization ideally to feel that overall,

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:09.280
 if not in this particular moment or even this week, that they're getting more out than they put in.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:15.280
 And if that's happening, then the community is working super well.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:24.280
 Definitely. But that also like this kind of burning out brings me to another part where it's just in so many communities and spaces,

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:32.280
 it's the case that there are just a few super active people who are like always on the edge of burning out, which is so problematic.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:42.280
 And if you like take them out of the community, then like, yeah, either space shuts down or other people come in

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:48.280
 and they manage to reorganize and they manage to create a better working structure.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:56.280
 And so realizing that yourself, that you're like running too much of the space maybe and taking a step back

01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:05.280
 and trying to get new people in, which adds to your own load because you need to educate them first about what they can be doing maybe.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.280
 But generally that's super important just to realize.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:17.280
 And I think we need to come back to that taking change given that if you're reliant on just a few really active members

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:23.280
 that that doesn't allow for change. It doesn't assume that at some point that's going to be different.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:26.280
 Yeah, and we need to look out for each other.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.280
 And we've had times at NoiseBridge and other groups I've been a part of where people are looking out for each other

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:38.280
 and just saying, I really appreciate everything you've been doing and I hate to say this,

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.280
 but I think you're doing too much and you need to do less because I'm afraid of what's going to happen.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.280
 Yeah, but other people can fill in. You don't have to feel responsible for everything.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:59.280
 And saying that in the light of both you stepping back is good for you as a person, but also is necessary for the community.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.280
 It's on both sides.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:09.280
 Indeed. And so in starting NoiseBridge, I have been the person burning out and taking all this stuff on

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.280
 and being afraid of if I don't do it, no one else will and no one will do it well or whatever, being a control freak about it.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.280
 And when I was like a teenager, that was exclusively what I did. But I kind of learned over time.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:28.280
 And when I was part of the group starting NoiseBridge, I insisted on it being an anarchist hackerspace

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.280
 because I knew that otherwise I might slip into that role again, which I could do too easily.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.280
 But if it's an anarchist space and everyone takes responsibility and that works, great.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.280
 I'm pretty willing to put tons of energy in as long as I'm getting more out than I put in.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.280
 And other people, if they step up and make that happen, wow, cool.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.280
 And if it doesn't, well, it was an experiment that was worth trying.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:56.280
 Unfortunately, I think we're pretty much at the end of our time here. This has been a marvelous conversation.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.280
 I like to talk for a lot longer.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:07.280
 I'd like to close with where can people find out more information and more resources?

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:15.280
 Where should people go if they have never been to a hackerspace and they want to go visit one or become involved with one?

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.280
 I would say hackerspaces.org is the first address.

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.280
 Like a few years ago, many people helped to bring more life into this again.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:33.280
 And also everybody can do that still to update if they find a space is not running anymore in their city,

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.280
 that they can just update the pages.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.280
 That's a list of all of the hackerspaces in the world that are not.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.280
 If they have been added, so you can add your own as well.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.280
 So that's super important.

01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:50.280
 And also to get the hackerspace design patterns, for example.

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:59.280
 And other resources, there are a bunch of articles written for hackerspaces.org about starting, running, solving problems at hackerspaces and other communities.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:05.280
 There's also links to lots of other articles written elsewhere that are online.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.280
 It's a wiki, so anyone can add content there.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.280
 And there's a lot of really good content there.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:19.280
 It's not as active as it was, say, six, seven, eight years ago, but it's still a really good resource.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:28.280
 There's also an email list that anyone can sign up for, whether they're running a hackerspace or wanting to or having problems,

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.280
 ask questions of many people who have ideas.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:38.280
 Many have perhaps been through problems that you're having, and you can ask questions and get really good answers.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:49.280
 Yeah, and depending on the location, if you're in Germany, of course, the list of CCC-connected hackerspaces is very long.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.280
 There's also the network of open workshops, which is an amazing resource as well.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.280
 So not all of these open workshops in Germany are like hackerspaces, but they are just also...

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.280
 Where can you find that?

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:09.280
 It's called Verbund offener Werkstätten, and they have a map also of all the kind of open workshops all over the German-speaking region.

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:18.280
 And it would be amazing to have this also globally or in other countries, so people should fork this, definitely.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:24.280
 And then on globalinnovationgathering.org, for example, we have a list of the members,

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:30.280
 or of most of the members who volunteered to put themselves in the database.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:36.280
 And what I find super interesting is also what we're mapping currently with Open Nowhere.

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:44.280
 So from the Internet of Production Alliance, there's this new standard created to find out where you can produce things.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:50.280
 And so you could also add machines and knowledge to this kind of map,

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:56.280
 and also profit from this map, of course, to find out where you can produce or create things.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.280
 So that's also super nice to check out.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.280
 Fantastic. Well, Aprika and Mitch, thank you so much for joining me for this chat.

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.280
 This was fantastic.

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.280
 You're very welcome. Thanks.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.280
 And thank you all at home for watching, and have a good night.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:17.280
 Thank you. Thank you.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.400
 Thank you.
