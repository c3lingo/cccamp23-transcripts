00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,080
 >> Our next talk is starting now if anyone wants to join us.

3
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,120
 There is, it's a bad omen for appreciation talk that nobody's here.

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
 >> I was alright.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,360
 >> Maybe we can run around and tell people to come appreciate.

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,560
 Dario, come here and listen to the talk.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,200
 Okay. I am introducing you nevertheless,

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,720
 and I hope that more people join us in the course of next 15 minutes.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,680
 This is Bonnie from the Free Software Foundation Europe.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,960
 She's talking about sharing the power of appreciation. Thank you.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,720
 >> Thank you. Hi. Thank you.

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,840
 I'm here today to talk to you about sharing the power for appreciation,

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,280
 and of course, the I Love Free Software Day.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,440
 First of all, I would like to say that this is one of my favorite, most favorites.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,840
 My English is not always perfect,

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,680
 but it's like the initiative that I like the most because

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,120
 there are several reasons for it which I will go

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,200
 through with you in the next 10-15 minutes.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,120
 Those reasons are, first of all,

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,840
 I will talk to you about what it is that makes the Free Software Day,

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
 and that's the power behind this day.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
 Then what is actually happening on this day?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
 What are we supposed to do?

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,600
 How can we share our appreciation?

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,760
 How can we reach out to others and let them know that we are a positive and welcoming community?

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,360
 Why do we need something like the I Love Free Software Day?

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,480
 Of course, nevertheless, how do we celebrate it actually?

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,800
 Those are the points that I would like to introduce to you.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,160
 First of all, I take you back on a journey.

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,480
 It's like a quick time travel back to 2010.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
 It's like 13 years ago,

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,680
 and it was a very small initiative at the beginning.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,240
 It was an idea that popped up in the FSFE

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,960
 about how can we make the Free Software communities more positive?

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,240
 How can we share appreciation for free software?

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,040
 How can we reach out to those people who are contributing to free software,

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,880
 make them seen by others so that others know,

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,440
 "Oh my God, it's not only developers who are doing something for free software.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
 There are so many people in it."

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,520
 For this, we chose the Valentine's Day.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:01,040
 I know it's several months before the Valentine's Day,

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,080
 and I know that the feeling for Valentine's Day is not yet there,

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,920
 and that it will pop up in February or early February.

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,960
 But still, it's a nice setting,

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,480
 and we are already in this mood for sharing our love,

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,080
 sharing appreciation for those people that we like and love.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,360
 Why couldn't we do that for free software as well?

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,880
 Why couldn't we do it for something that we care so deeply about?

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,640
 Because free software is not only a software that we use,

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,800
 but it's something that empowers us,

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,240
 that gives us the power to use, study, share, and improve.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,200
 So it's something that we thought might be a very good day for this.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,200
 And that's how it all started 13 years ago.

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 So what is this all about?

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 Each year on the 14th of February, we share our love, appreciation,

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,680
 and gratitude for all those people contributing to free software.

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,640
 So as I said, it's not only developers, it's translators as well.

58
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 It's those who do this design.

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,440
 So there are so many people involved in free software projects,

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,280
 and it's nice to highlight them and to say thank you,

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,440
 and to reach out to them and let them be seen by others.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
 How do you do that?

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,200
 You can do this on social networks, of course,

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,280
 and highlight free software projects or contribute to those.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
 And you can, of course, also do offline actions,

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,960
 with sending postcards, organizing events or meetups.

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,680
 And most importantly, you can donate money to them.

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
 Free software projects are worth something,

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,520
 and they are not only worth our time, they are also worth some money.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,320
 And it's nice to think about free software

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,000
 as something that we can participate in

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,640
 and that we have the power to be part of.

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
 So that's what's happening on this day.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,800
 That's why I think this day is very important.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,120
 And now to the point, why do I think it's so important?

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,840
 Everybody appreciates a thank you.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
 It's not only me who appreciates a thank you,

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
 it's everybody in this room here as well.

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,240
 It's like a nice thing to say thank you once a time.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,920
 And also, as you probably know, in free software communities,

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,640
 we do not always have the nicest tone.

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,600
 We are sometimes like, "Why do you create this issue?

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
 Look up the doku."

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,680
 And it's not always very easy to take part in free software projects

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,520
 and to feel like the work that you're contributing to those projects

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,160
 is actually valued.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,680
 So we should create a more positive and welcoming communities.

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,720
 And I do think that by saying thank you, we start something.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,480
 We can motivate others to contribute, to keep doing this.

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,160
 Because if I say thank you to you, it's not like I'm just saying,

91
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
 "Hi, and good that you do that," whatever, continue.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,880
 It's like, "I'm really appreciating what you're doing."

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
 So it's motivating.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,000
 It also acknowledges the work that we are doing for this project.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,480
 And it should be more than just some words.

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,000
 It should be very nice and...

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,480
 Now I'm thrown off at the time, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,160
 It should be nice and it should be valuing those people who are contributing.

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,520
 So we do raise awareness with the say as well,

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,480
 because a lot is happening on the social media networks with this.

101
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,680
 And people do see free software communities, free software projects

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,560
 that they might not have heard of before.

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,560
 So it's like we are also reaching out to other free software communities

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,840
 that we have not been in contact with before.

105
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,280
 For example, we had one of those I Love Free Software days about free software games.

106
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,040
 I'm not a big gamer and I never hear anything about

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,640
 all those things that are needed for free software games.

108
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 It was a nice opportunity for us to connect more free software projects

109
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,120
 with each other and to create a welcoming and nice community.

110
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
 So this is also what we are doing with this day.

111
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,640
 We are raising awareness for the various free software communities out there,

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,400
 for free software itself.

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
 We can talk to other people, we can organize events,

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,080
 we can contact people that might be in the hack space,

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,720
 but have not yet heard so much about free software and say,

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 "Hey, come on this day, let's share our knowledge,

117
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 let's share our appreciation for free."

118
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,020
 free software.

119
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,940
 And of course, as I said before, I can't say it more often because it's very important

120
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,920
 for me to create a positive and welcoming community that appreciates the work that's

121
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,220
 done for free software projects and not only focusing on the negative but also on the positive.

122
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,500
 So how do we celebrate Dialogue Free Software Day?

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,060
 I have already given some examples, like the one with the free software games events that

124
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,860
 we organised, but there are more.

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,620
 So a few years ago, quite some years ago, we did, for example, send a lot of roses

126
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:14,140
 to every member of the German parliament attached with an open letter to, well, how

127
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:21,580
 to put it nicely, to basically make them aware of free software and to give the hint that

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,340
 it might be a cool thing to also do some more work for or to focus on free software and

129
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,940
 politics as well.

130
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,780
 So this was done by the Free Software Foundation in Europe.

131
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,020
 It was a lot of work because, as you can imagine, there are a lot of people in the German parliament,

132
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,380
 but it was worth our time because you get in contact with them, they are happy that

133
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,820
 you sent them a rose, like it's a very nice thing, and they also get some information

134
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,340
 about free software attached with the rose.

135
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,800
 So this was one of the events that has happened on the Dialogue Free Software Day.

136
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,700
 But also others are contributing to the state.

137
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,980
 This is Salando organising a panel for the Dialogue Free Software Day in 2019.

138
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,740
 Salando is doing a lot of work for open source, but this is not the point.

139
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,540
 They are also, like there are a lot of people out there, it's not only the Free Software

140
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,180
 Foundation Europe who are participating in the Dialogue Free Software Day, also companies.

141
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:24,140
 And some more recent examples, we have also made it easier for you by creating a share

142
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,660
 pick generator that you can use to share your love for free software very easily.

143
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,940
 So this was also done by one of our volunteers who wanted to make the Dialogue Free Software

144
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,300
 Day more accessible and more easy to attach a nice picture, a message by sharing a share

145
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,740
 pick on your favourite social media.

146
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,460
 And of course, we also sent a lot of postcards to a lot of free software projects that we

147
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,740
 liked or that we appreciated in the team.

148
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,380
 And yeah, say it, thank you to them.

149
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,900
 So it was quite a nice action, but it was a lot of writing, and I do think it was great

150
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,620
 fun in the office.

151
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,940
 So yeah.

152
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,380
 And of course others are also participating.

153
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,320
 As I said before, it's also other organisations.

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,640
 This is for example from this year's I Love Free Software Day and the share pick generator

155
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,200
 idea picked up quite good.

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,160
 So others are doing this now as well, different designs of course.

157
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,020
 And also participating.

158
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,200
 There's also a lot of other organisations who participate in this day very constantly

159
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
 every year.

160
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,940
 So it's something that's already quite established, but I still notice that a lot of people have

161
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:46,500
 not yet heard so much about it or thought about why they should participate personally.

162
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,300
 And of course we also organised meet ups and make it possible, especially after all those

163
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,380
 times where we had to stay apart.

164
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,460
 And it was quite a nice thing to meet people who are contributing to free software.

165
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,500
 This can also be a good thing to actually start projects again or to keep working on

166
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,860
 them because maybe you have also noticed not sitting in the hack space or not meeting up

167
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,160
 with your peers can be demotivating sometimes for programming, so this day can also be an

168
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,140
 option for you to restart something and to continue working on it.

169
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,500
 So what are we going to do for the next I Love Free Software Day?

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:34,620
 The next one will be focusing on organising workshops, meet ups in our local library,

171
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
 youth clubs, etc.

172
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,980
 So it's more about going outside of our realm and reaching out to other people who are not

173
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,260
 yet contributing to free software projects or who are not yet part of the free software

174
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,940
 communities and letting them know about free software.

175
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,020
 This day is supposed to be a day where we share our love for free software, where we

176
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:00,220
 share our appreciation and where we also raise awareness for free software projects.

177
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,900
 So that's the idea for the next I Love Free Software Day.

178
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,980
 As I said before, it's an initiative that lives by other people, so we can't do this on our

179
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
 own.

180
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,060
 We need you to participate in this day because if we only say thank you, then it's very nice

181
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,620
 and others are happy about this, yes, of course, but it's also nice to hear thank you from

182
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,680
 others as well and it's also nice if more people participate and share their appreciation

183
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,740
 and love for free software and create welcoming communities.

184
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:39,340
 So it's about spreading the word for free software, showing your love for free software,

185
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,420
 and being part of the I Love Free Software Day and the free software movement.

186
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,620
 And of course, most importantly, say thank you to other free software projects.

187
00:12:51,620 --> 00:13:01,020
 So I think I put it all in there and I'm happy to take your questions if you have some.

188
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:09,460
 Contribute, spread the word, donate with time or money and yeah, we are over there at FSFE

189
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:18,460
 booth so you can also visit us there if you want.

190
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,460
 Thank you, Borne, for the talk.

191
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,220
 Are there any questions?

192
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:30,860
 How many of the members of the German Parliament replied and how?

193
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,220
 This is so many years ago that I can't tell you anymore.

194
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,140
 I'm so sorry.

195
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:44,020
 I will try to find out and I will look it up, okay?

196
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:51,820
 Are there any more questions?

197
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,060
 I mean it was pretty straightforward.

198
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,420
 I do think so as well.

199
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,540
 As I said before, it's an important initiative for me.

200
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,780
 I think it's a very nice thing.

201
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,220
 I also think it's something that we should not only do once a year but keep doing and

202
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,380
 it's something that we should keep in mind the whole time when we are communicating with

203
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,220
 other people who are contributing to free software projects.

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,980
 Maybe you want to say something about the stickers and the postcards which are down

205
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
 there.

206
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
 Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

207
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,260
 We have some stickers, postcards and yeah, you can use them to share your love for free

208
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
 software.

209
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,900
 You can also send those postcards to other free software contributors and don't forget

210
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,740
 there's the cows post.

211
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,540
 So you can even send them on the camp here and reach out to your favorite free software

212
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,980
 project here and let them know that you really appreciate them and that you think they are

213
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,540
 doing great work and say thank you.

214
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
 Good idea.

215
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,500
 Thank you for being here.

216
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,820
 Thank you.

217
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,740
 [Applause]

218
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,340
