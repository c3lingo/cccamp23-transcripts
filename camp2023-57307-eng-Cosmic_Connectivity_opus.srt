 >> More or less.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hi, I'm Oliver.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Who of you has heard of Starlink?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 That's great.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Who of you has played with a Starlink?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Oh, one?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 That's not a lot.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 All right, so that's why I think it's a good time to talk about what's happening in space

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 and what the next frontier not only from a technology perspective

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 but also for the hacker community might look like.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So yeah, we're talking about things that may go boom

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and it's exciting times and everyone that's following also what's happening with SpaceX

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 but also the greater space theme is quite excited what's happening right now.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Really interesting times.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So what's my motivation for being here?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So I have long time contacts with CCC even though I'm not a member,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 even though the Burger House, I'm Spittel, no, Eidelstedt.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So long time ago, so I know a bit what I'm doing.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 But what took me here is that I did some testing, part of my job for a client,

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 and I looked at how does this thing perform?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 How does a Starlink work when it's in motion?

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And yes, we even have Autobahn that look like railways.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So you may draw your own conclusions what that means.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 So I filled my car, had a Starlink mounted to it,

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and looked at how can we quantify what's going on, especially when that thing is in motion.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So basic setup, took the data there, measured power, put that in a time series database,

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 graphed it a little.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So nothing super strange and serious, but the outcome was quite interesting.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So just as an example, I saw that the performance of that thing was surprisingly good.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 So the ping performance when you're driving at German Autobahn speed,

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 even when this overhead power line is moving over that thing,

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 is really good and very often beats what's happening in the mobile world.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So you can see throughput, and this is not an advertisement section,

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 it's more like my personal experience, what really draw my attention to it.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So this was more casual test that I can talk about.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So 280 megabits down, 50 plus megabits up, and very nice latency figures.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Power was not something that you would be concerned of,

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 so this is the high power antenna setup, the consumer thing is more or less equal,

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 but works really nice.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So after all, it draws little power, it has high performance, and ping is super cool.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I see ping rates of like 30 to 60 milliseconds,

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 which is a very good performance even in a mobile network setting.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So wow, how does that work? Why does it work? And what makes it so amazing?

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So just from a technology perspective, I tried to condense it a little bit.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 What do we want to have? We want to have a user terminal and a ground terminal,

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 and there's one or multiple satellites flying above in the skies,

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 and somehow this gets connected to the Internet.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So easy peasy, nothing super complex, obviously behind the scenes,

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 there's a lot of stuff happening.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 But also we see now that these mega constellations are popping up,

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and every couple of weeks we hear a new announcement

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 with even bigger numbers of how many satellites we're expecting to see.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 So the world is changing here.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 In previous times we had the Iridium, the VSSAT, and also SAS as players

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 that were mostly working from geostationary orbit,

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and now we have these LEO low earth orbit constellations,

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 like Starlink, Amazon, Project Kuiper is about to come,

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 OneWeb is also up and running by now.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 So we see a lot of players that are already there and there's much more to come.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And the benefit of what's happening there is they're flying really low.

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So low earth orbit is anything up to 2,000 kilometers in height,

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 whereas geostationary is like 35,000 kilometers.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And you can really see the difference when you look at the calculated ping times

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 or round trip times for a signal when you take into account speed of light.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 So something in the 3 to 4 milliseconds for the orbits that Starlink is using,

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 8 milliseconds for what OneWeb is using, O3b is like 53 milliseconds,

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 all that is really, it feels like you're using a proper network more or less.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Whereas in previous times the geostationary players had these 250, 240 milliseconds,

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 and that's just the time it takes the signal to travel back and forth.

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 The real problem also on top of that is what's the network infrastructure

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and is it just a bent pipe on the satellite that is just downlinking the signal

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 that is being sent to him or is it networking equipment that's somewhere up in the air.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So all that adds latency.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So just to give you a perspective on how this thing works mechanically,

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 there's Newton's cannonball.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So how do you put a satellite into orbit?

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 First you need to launch it up there, but then it needs to be really fast.

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So it tries to drop down to earth and the speed of it needs to be higher,

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 so it always misses earth when it drops.

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And so that's what we're aiming for is a radial orbit that nicely circles the earth there.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And the problem you will find there is it's moving quite quickly.

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So 7,600 meters per second, that's quite quick.

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And that brings the next challenge.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So you see the earth and you see the antennas

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and the new generation of low earth orbit constellations tends to use flat panel antennas.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 These are really marvels of radio design and can really do wonders

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 and be it patch antennas or Lundenberg lenses and whatever is happening there.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Lots of development going on in that area.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And the aim is to really drive down costs and to make it more or less a consumer device.

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 But these antennas have a field of view and depending what technology,

94
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 more or less it's 110 or 140 degrees give or take.

95
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So that's a fixed angle and when you're looking up to the sky, the satellite passes over you

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 and you only have a small time window of like 160, maybe 240 seconds depending on the orbit

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 where you can see what's happening.

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So anything above the horizon is not of interest to you.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You don't want to use that because there's more attenuation

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and also the antennas have some limits on how fast they can steal the beam electronically.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So clever calculations going on there and depending on the orbit, how high you fly,

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 it more or less tells you how many satellites you need.

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So you end up making your calculations, how do I build a constellation?

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And you come up with quite exciting numbers depending on what your orbit is,

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 what your business model is, what kind of customers you're serving.

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 So you tend to build a Walker Delta constellation where you space the separate shells around the globe

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 and they fly around the globe and you define more or less when you're designing that

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 how many segments are flying at the same time.

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And you can also have them fly over the polar region if your customers are up into Arctic and Antarctic business,

110
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 whatever that is, and you can also stagger them and that becomes of interest, for example,

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 when you want to communicate between your satellites.

112
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 We come later to that.

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So that's the key factor for dimensioning your minimum viable constellation.

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 The next factor that adds on to that is what business do you expect?

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So what bandwidth do you have? Where do you expect your customers to be?

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 How big will be your cells that you're serving?

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And that also comes down to where are your customers?

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 So you design your network also where the customers are.

119
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So you want to have pops that exfiltrate the user traffic to the Internet,

120
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 but also you want to have gateways that are more or less close to the customer

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 so that the distance of travel for the signal can be optimized.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And there is lots of thinking.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 For example, in Germany currently we have two gateway stations,

124
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 whereas in the US where there seems to be more customers for Starlink, there are many more stations.

125
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 What you also can do is to route the traffic between satellites,

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and that becomes very interesting and useful when you're, for example, serving the marine industry.

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I recently spoke to a guy that's working with oil platforms, and he said,

128
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 "Wow, Leo is just a godsend for me. I've been really ripped off for nothing, like two megabits,

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 and always could saturate that link, and now we can really do remote management.

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 We can do even a Teams call from our oil rig, and for costs that's next to nothing compared to what they paid in previous times."

131
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So how do you reach these remote areas?

132
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You just hand over to hop via the satellites that are orbiting in Earth.

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So it's just another opportunity to have a network mesh flying above our heads.

134
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So when you launch a satellite, what happens?

135
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 First of all, you shoot them up.

136
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Probably many have watched these SpaceX or whatever videos, and then the satellite gets released.

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And that's not the final orbit, usually.

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 They are staged there, and then they are checked if they work, and then they are raised in the orbit.

139
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And remember the picture we saw about these orbital shells?

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So every satellite has a pre-assigned space where it needs to end up.

141
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So you need to get the timing right to raise the satellites, and you see that this tends to work.

142
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 For example, in this case, the famous Johnston McDowell is the data pope for anything satellite-related.

143
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 He's creating all these cool graphs, so definitely needs that mentioning here.

144
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But what also can happen is that the satellites do not reach their orbit.

145
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 In the left part of the scale, you see lots of satellites dropping out.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So what happened? We had a sun storm.

147
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So the solar activity warmed up the Earth atmosphere, which resulted in additional drag.

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 So the atmosphere expanded, and the satellites got slower and slower.

149
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 You remember Newton's cannon. That didn't work out well.

150
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So many just returned to Earth before they could be placed in the destination orbit.

151
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Tough luck, but when you're dealing with large numbers, that's something that just happens.

152
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 But also when you're putting new technology into the game, just recently SpaceX launched a new version,

153
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 the V2 Mini, and that cohort also had some issues that needed to be resolved.

154
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So some of them were raised, and then they were lowering their orbit.

155
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Some were already deorbiting, and some probably could fix their issues, and then they reached orbit.

156
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But that batch didn't look too well.

157
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But usually, if you look at it, it's more a mixed bag.

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Some make it, some don't make it, and you see that the numbers, it's in the lower 1% range that doesn't really make it.

159
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So overall, in the bigger scheme of things, it's not such a tough loss.

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You also see the difference between, for example, Starlink and OneWeb.

161
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Where Starlink seems to be also very much focused on consumer business,

162
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 OneWeb seems to be more focused on a reseller B2B business, and also has a lower density of satellites there.

163
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But that also tells you about what's the maximum throughput of the total constellation,

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 or the maximum throughput you can get when many consumers subscribe in a certain area to that service.

165
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So lots of arbitrage happening here.

166
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And another thing is service availability.

167
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 You need to liaise with every regulator in every market, every country you want to serve,

168
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 because they want to have their say.

169
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You're not generating subscribers.

170
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So probably some have heard about the Iran story that SpaceX was asked to allow people to use it in Iran,

171
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 even though it's not being sold in Iran.

172
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 What's happening is, well, the Emirates and other places seem to be interesting places to ship stuff in that area.

173
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But slowly it's growing, and just in the last two weeks, I guess, Malaysia was at it.

174
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So it's all moving quite swiftly.

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And even right now, if you look at the satellite tracker sites,

176
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 usually you see like 10, 12, 15 even satellites that have a line of sight between you and the gateway.

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So for the terminal you're having, it has a lot of choice which satellite to talk to.

178
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And it's not a given that always the shortest path is used.

179
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 So there's lots of scheduling and algorithms working there just to, from a constellation perspective,

180
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 manage the traffic as best as possible.

181
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And the satellites also move, and they also can avoid, for example, running into other satellites.

182
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So how do you get that data?

183
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And there's some cool companies out there like Leo Labs,

184
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 and they basically used something that was used in science for ionospheric science radars.

185
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 They were tracking satellites.

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Because they needed to more or less subtract that information

187
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 and found out that the subtraction was more of a business.

188
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 So there's a lot of data providers that tell you where at any given point in time a satellite is

189
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 and what the trajectory of that satellite will be.

190
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So you can forecast over time is there the risk of a conjunction.

191
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And then you need to move your satellite, and hopefully you get enough fuel left over

192
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 so you can replace it, move it upwards, downwards, just to avoid any traffic collisions.

193
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Which is not something you want to have happening because that very quickly has the chance to spoil your whole orbit.

194
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So what's the key advances that are happening?

195
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Again, this is not a SpaceX sales show, but certainly these guys moved the needle quite significantly,

196
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 both with their Falcon 9 and potentially with their Starship.

197
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So the reusability and the launch cadence that they can launch, even multiple flights per week,

198
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 is truly impressive, and that has not happened before.

199
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And that's really what is the game changer in all of this.

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And if you look at the cost to orbit, that's a key indicator,

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 how much it costs to send one kilogram into low Earth orbit.

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 You see that more or less the cost to orbit has remained the same,

203
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 give or take $10,000 or $12,000 per kilogram.

204
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And you can have serious and long discussions about the validity of this data, trust me.

205
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 You don't want to really dig down deep into this.

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You come into discussions that maybe even reusability doesn't work and raises costs, whatever.

207
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 But just as a key indicator for the calculation,

208
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 it's how much does it cost me to send one kilogram up to orbit and also for a given size.

209
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So we're not talking about these small cube sets, but solid piece of kit,

210
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 not like a geostationary one that's tons, but hundreds of kilograms.

211
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And over time, if you highlight that,

212
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 these guys are really rocking the boat by lowering or saying they will be able to lower costs by orders of magnitude.

213
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I don't know how this plays out. We all know these Elon Musk announcements.

214
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But if that becomes true, that really changes the game for anything happening in space.

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And that's what's really, really impressive right now.

216
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 In the meantime, there's quite some supply gap in the market

217
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 because there's lots of constellations trying to get their stuff up in the air,

218
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 hundreds and thousands of satellites and also Russia not being able to launch currently.

219
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 So there is a supply gap. And even worse, if you have a constellation,

220
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 the key limiting factor is the frequencies you use there.

221
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And you had to apply for these and the licenses usually say you need to be able to demonstrate

222
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 that you have like 50% of your constellation up and running and are using these frequencies.

223
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 However, there's a supply gap right now and many players in the market are currently battling with that.

224
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So very interesting times and some extensions are being granted right now.

225
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And certainly there is someone who can profit from that.

226
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If you look at the absolute figures of how many large objects were being put into space,

227
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 that's from end of last year, you really see that there has been an explosion.

228
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And the growth rate has just never happened before in history.

229
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So these mega constellations really change also the demand on the space launch site.

230
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And at least until the end of last year, the dominant player was not one web.

231
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And customers seem to like that. So there's good growth.

232
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Well, 1.5 million Starlink subscribers in the biggest scheme of things.

233
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 That's not something that really moves the needle when you're working in telco.

234
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 But anyhow, that's strong growth that's happening right now.

235
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And that's also being shown in the valuation.

236
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Don't want to go deep into that one.

237
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It's really crazy what's happening there. A company that's worth 150 billion.

238
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And the key value driver for that is not the rocket business of SpaceX, but also certainly the Starlink business.

239
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But there's others there. So just to give you an image,

240
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Amazon will probably end of this year, early next year, demonstrate their service.

241
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And what they showed as terminals looks really nice.

242
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And if you look at the size of it, the small one, that's really neat.

243
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You can put it next to your coffee mug and feel cozy somewhere out in the woods.

244
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 But there's also other ones that are more geared towards business uses.

245
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 For example, what one web you ordered from Hughes.

246
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So there's lots of stuff happening and also on the terminal side.

247
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So expect terminals, the antennas to become much smaller, much more lightweight.

248
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Also power consumption will go down.

249
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 There's serious development happening right there.

250
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 But certainly that has some security implications.

251
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And you might have heard about the VSAT hack that happened on the first day when Ukraine was attacked.

252
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 You saw the traffic dropping there.

253
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And what happened there was that some malware was used and that they access VSAT.

254
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 They were, as they state, poorly configured VPN and then were able to move into the network

255
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 and the management network and then into the part that's able to control the software downloads.

256
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And unfortunately, there was some collateral damage.

257
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 So like 11 gigawatts in wind turbines were left without being controllable

258
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 because they were using VSAT.

259
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 So that's a bit unfortunate.

260
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And there may be reasons why you want to be able to control that.

261
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So you see things are happening and that's government actors here.

262
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And yes, if you read what's really being talked there,

263
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 there might have been some 14 VPN appliances involved.

264
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And the question is, was that patched and has anybody learned from previous attacks on these devices?

265
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Usual security practice should be applied there.

266
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And yes, there's more moving targets in there like ground station operators.

267
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Some are controlling everything in their value chain.

268
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Others are using existing players in that market, also like distributors, resellers,

269
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and everyone needs to have access to parts of the network.

270
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Another one happening recently was Dozor Teleport.

271
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That's a Russian provider that works for the military.

272
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And that was attacked a couple of days ago.

273
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And there was data exfiltrated and not such a long time it was off if you look at the data.

274
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 But what was exfiltrated, believe it or not, because it was attributed to Wagner,

275
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 but some would say that that should be taken with more than a grain of salt.

276
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Some basic infrastructure how a satellite provider works.

277
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So lots of interesting data out there if you fancy looking into that.

278
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 There's also official hackathons going on.

279
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 So Hackaset just happened and also ESA did some hack size with Thales.

280
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That was very interesting to watch what happened there.

281
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 They provided a dummy satellite, a real satellite, and Hackaset also used a real satellite this time.

282
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So there was an exercise being done.

283
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 How can you hack a satellite?

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And even though that is a platform where you can more or less register your payload

285
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 that gets uploaded and executed, you can download the pictures, whatever,

286
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 you can gain control if you know how.

287
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And the intrusion more or less persisted, the threat there.

288
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And so that would have been some uncontrolled environment.

289
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 This was all friendly work that was done.

290
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 That's not so nice to have happening.

291
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 But that's nothing new.

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 There's lots of stories on how satellites were hacked over the years.

293
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And even satellites were brought down and crashed back to Earth.

294
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So what do you do?

295
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 First of all, don't trust the network.

296
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It may be compromised as any other network.

297
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And certainly do not assume availability.

298
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 For example, if you're running wind turbines and always also use encryption if you're doing that.

299
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And maybe even look if the network looks trustworthy for you over time,

300
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 like some crazy BGP stuff happening.

301
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 But from a hacker's perspective, this is not a new thing.

302
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 You may remember Captain Midnight that was jamming the cable TV signal back in the US.

303
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Or Max Hatroom where some guy broadcasts signals up to the satellite that was distributing.

304
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And not that long ago, in the Czech Republic, you remember these TV channels where a camera is panning over nice landscapes.

305
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So that should stimulate tourism.

306
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Some folks changed that and also showed some nuclear explosion in that imagery.

307
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 So that raised an eyebrow or two.

308
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 But I mentioned that earlier, there's lots of attack vectors here.

309
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 So there's the end user devices, the router, the antenna that's being used.

310
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And that's all in the hands of many, many, many people.

311
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 So security researchers as well.

312
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 But you can also have a look at all the internal structure.

313
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 We talked about the command and control that's necessary to keep the constellation at work,

314
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 the collision avoidance that's happening there.

315
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 So that's absolutely critical and of highest importance to keep alive.

316
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But there's lots of other customer facing systems like billing or websites that allow for interesting work.

317
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 What I want to convey is the message.

318
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 There's lots and lots of moving wheels in this whole thing.

319
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 It's a highly complex thing.

320
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And I'm even tending to compare it to what's happening in a mobile network.

321
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 It's really super complex.

322
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And you can even look at physical avenues of making contact.

323
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And I don't know if you can see that.

324
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 That's not a James Bond movie.

325
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 That's a mission that's due to happen in the not too distant future by ESA.

326
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 That's going to capture a satellite.

327
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And you will see many more players in that field that, for example, will be refueling satellites or repositioning satellites.

328
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 So there's interesting stuff happening in that arena.

329
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But you can also be more down to earth and just use open source intelligence.

330
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 When a player is, for example, applying for licenses with a local council to build a gateway,

331
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 they make nice presentations and tell you how these antennas work, how much power is being used.

332
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 One of the more interesting pieces of work in the recent time was done by Leonard Wouters at BlackHat.

333
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 So he was glitching the older version of the Starlink terminal and more or less achieved full control of that one.

334
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Very nice attack.

335
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And so he was able to get root and be persistent there and also played fairly with Starlink.

336
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And also Starlink moved very swiftly and professionally on that side.

337
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 There's this interesting work on reverse engineering the network infrastructure.

338
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 So Pan and others are measuring latency and trace routes at scale so they can have a decent information on how this works.

339
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And you can make your inferences on how the network and the back hole backlinks look like.

340
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 There's also interesting work happening on how the Starlink scheduler works.

341
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And it turns out that what has been circulating through Reddit and whatever,

342
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 there is a 15 second scheduling window in the terminal and every 15 seconds the terminal might pick a new satellite.

343
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And you see this difference in ping situation happening there.

344
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And you see also that different devices or MAC addresses might be treated differently,

345
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 possibly in their internal routing happening there.

346
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Interesting work.

347
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Also, for example, which satellites are being preferred?

348
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 So they looked at the obstruction maps in the Starlink terminal.

349
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 So the terminal maps the trajectory of a satellite to find out if there are any obstructions in its field of vision.

350
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And they found that more or less it tends to use anything with an inclination of 45 to 90 degrees.

351
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 There may be variances depending on where the terminal is.

352
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And also, for example, there's an exclusion zone.

353
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 You don't want your Starlink to beam into the geostationary orbit because there's some frequency reuse happening there.

354
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Another way of getting information about that providers work by Microsoft,

355
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 where they looked at screenshots from speed tests posted on Reddit and also the user sentiment happening there.

356
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So they found out that speed seemed to decrease or latency seemed to increase over time.

357
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And now it's going down as the constellation is expanding.

358
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 So there's lots of alternative ways to look at that.

359
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And another one was how to break the service.

360
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 There was a way to tell the terminal to be a GPRC to style the antenna and then break the router.

361
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 More or less that made it incapable of being without power cycling being used again.

362
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 There's a nice SSH console available or not available with a nice greeting.

363
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And there's also bug bounty programs from one web, SpaceX is doing the same.

364
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 That also, let's say, that gives inspiration on where to look or hopefully not to look.

365
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And also one web is doing that, so I'm speeding up a little.

366
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Yeah, lots of interesting things happening here.

367
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And there's one more thing.

368
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Mobile is going satellite as well.

369
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 You may have heard about T-Mobile cooperating with Starlink.

370
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And there's other players out in that market that will more or less fly base stations over your head.

371
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 And that's also happening in the standardization circuit of 3GPP.

372
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 That is defining 5G, 6G, 7G over time.

373
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Lots of interesting stuff to happen there because that will provide mobile access pretty much all around the globe.

374
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 So complex systems, many angles of attack, lots of uncharted territory.

375
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So this is more an invitation from my point of view to look into this.

376
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Because over time the importance of these mega constellations will be high.

377
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And I expect the services to grow.

378
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And I'd rather have them safe and sound and work well and not being shut down by, for example, military aggressors.

379
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 So overall I'm super excited what's going on right now.

380
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Really attractive products coming out.

381
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I would expect that Amazon will be an aggressive and value-driven consumer offer.

382
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Reliability is high. It works.

383
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 I'm a happy farmer using that.

384
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And I'm being shown the five minutes sign now.

385
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 So I'm opening up for questions now.

386
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 [Applause]

387
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 So are there any questions?

388
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 We have microphones.

389
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 If you have a question, wait for the microphone so the stream can also hear you.

390
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Anyone? Yes.

391
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 It might be a dummy question. Sorry for that, Aba.

392
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Can you speak up? There's lots of...

393
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 I wonder why other satellites have a fixed orbit scope, like the web one is 1000 kilometers, etc.

394
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Aba, the space thing is 350 to 550 kilometers.

395
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 So why is that? Why is the difference all the time? Is there any explanation of that?

396
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 These are just considerations, I guess, on how much bandwidth you want to provide in your constellation.

397
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 And if you fly lower, you more or less can put more satellites in your shells and create less interference between.

398
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 He was in the microphone. That was not a question.

399
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 So you said it yourself, the economic viability is not yet proven.

400
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 So do you see a way that this whole crumbles again when it's not going to be profitable anyway?

401
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 It's a big bet. You're asking about the economic viability.

402
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 That needs to be proven. People need to buy that service and pay good money for that.

403
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 And I expect there will be dropouts in that game. And there already have been dropouts.

404
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 And it's a highly competitive space. So I'm not making any bets right now.

405
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 However, there seems to be huge confidence from the financial community, at least in some players, that they're investing money there.

406
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 So they have maybe found the magic formula there.

407
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 And perhaps the last question from the gentleman with the ESA cap.

408
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Just so happens. Yeah, you said that you were using the Starlink user terminals from the moving car at German Autobahn speeds, which can be scary high.

409
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 As far as I understand, that's not actually supported.

410
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 So did you see any weird effects? Did they detect that you were having too high Doppler speeds and drop you out?

411
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Did you see handover issues, stuff like that?

412
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 No, they actually support certain speeds. And there's a moving subscription there.

413
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 But they also provide service for planes. So technically, the Doppler speeds of a satellite passing over your head versus the speed I'm running on a German highway is not that big, the delta there.

414
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 But certainly they can detect a lot. And I know that in the early days they were not using geofencing, so they were very liberal.

415
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 And now they are trying to more or less slice and dice their product portfolio for different use cases, which they have any right to do, even if it may be annoying for me.

416
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 But they have a lot of telemetry, I'm pretty sure.

417
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 One of the words you most used in your speech was market.

418
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 So these marks that really, there was a change from the last century when space was done by governments or international organizations like ESA, and now it's private companies.

419
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 So I have three questions. One is, do you think, as these are the same Amazon and Elon Musk, who are already the digital feudalism of five American men defining the rules of our digital communication, will this be reinforced by the satellite thing?

420
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 And my second question would be, is there some movement of people who say space should be a common, which is owned by us all and not by private companies?

421
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 There is some legal framework there. There's the space treaty. But what's happening right now is not a regulated market.

422
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 So it's really a first come first serve. And there's interesting papers, for example, from China, where they look at that highly critical and say, we must be in that game in order to be able to compete.

423
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Otherwise, the orbits will all be polluted by other players, for example.

424
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Regarding the, is it US only? No. China, for example, will bring up a huge constellation. There's a wasp here. You go away, please. Thanks.

425
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 There, Europe will have a constellation up and running, Iris 2. However, that will look like. It's up in the air for me, but the tender is out now.

426
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 That will be more focused on government and critical infrastructure users, but also to provide benefits, especially for Africa, where satellite Internet certainly has a high net benefit for the local communities, because providing high bandwidth through traditional means in rural places is super costly and therefore not happening in many times.

427
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 So I see your point. You need the money to bring the satellites up there. We're talking about billions. And that's where market dynamics kick in. I guess that's the sad truth.

428
00:45:38,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Well, thank you very much. I think it was exceptionally good talk. Very interesting topic. So thank you very much for coming. And we are out of time now because the next talk is also be here in 14 minutes now. And we need some time to change the stage. And thank you very much for coming. And if you have more questions, you can do it privately.

429
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 I will be around here for a minute.

430
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Thank you.
