 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hello, hi.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hi everybody.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 We are having a game scheduled at this stage right now.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 If you want to stay and play the game, it's going to be in English.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 So we're going to start very soon.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 If you want to stay, you're welcome to stay.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 If you don't want to stay, you can also stay and hang out.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And the game is called Gnomic.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's not like any other game you've played.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It's going to blow your mind.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 You're going to want to tell everybody about this game.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Especially if you are a nerd in law or it's going to be fun.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And the fundamental idea of this game is about changing rules.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So you make the rules of the game.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So can I have a show of hands who's going to stay and join the game?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 If you want to stay and join the game, would you come closer and take a chair or bench and come closer?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Because that will involve a bit of talking.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So if you want to stay and play the game, please come closer to me and sit in a circle.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I mean, come closer if you want.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 It's better that everybody sits in a circle if you want to join the game.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 You can continue eating, having your lunch.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Wow.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 A alpaca.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Nice.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Great.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 All good?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Everybody who's going to join the game?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Nice.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So I have the rules. There's an initial set of rules that I have it on an online notepad.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 That if you want to look at it on your own device, you're welcome to scan the QR code.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I think that will give you access, the viewing access to the notepad.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Which I will -- oh, sorry.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I think -- which I will show on a screen as well.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 But in case you want to have a reference in your hand, you're welcome to scan the QR code.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Does it work?

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Yes.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Good, great. Awesome.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So I have the editing rights to the pad.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And the fundamental idea of the game is that every move every player plays is a suggestion of changing the rules.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Okay?

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So every one of you, every player of you will participate by making suggestions to change the rules of the game.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Okay?

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And there are two sets of rules, two types of rules to begin with.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 One is immutable rules, which means immutable -- mutable means -- oh, okay.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Mutable means that you are able to change.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Immutable rules means that they are not -- you cannot change it.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But you can make suggestions to move it to mutable rules.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Then you can change it.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Do you understand?

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What does it mean?

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Okay.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So this is the mutable rules.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And this is the immutable rules.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Okay?

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 So these -- the rules in the category of immutable rules, you are not able to change them to begin with.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Question.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So which rules are immutable?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Here we can see the ones that begin with one, 101, these are immutable rules.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And the ones that begin with two are mutable rules.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Okay?

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So what it means is that when we start playing, if you want to change the rule of 101, you first have to suggest that we move 101 to the second box, which is here, 20.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Question?

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Do you understand?

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So everything that starts with one are immutable rules, and they cannot be changed directly.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 You cannot say, oh, I want to change one or something.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But in the box of 201, they are mutable rules, and you can suggest to change them directly.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 For example, this rule that says one turn takes no more than three minutes, you can suggest to change it to one turn takes up to five minutes, let's say.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Okay?

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But if it is in the number of one or something, whatever is in there, you have to say, okay, now we move them into this box before changing them.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Does it make sense?

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Do you understand?

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Great.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Okay. If you have any question, please ask at any moment.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Yes.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Question?

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 The game.

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 What is the goal of the game?

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That is the best question.

83
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Exactly.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 What is the goal of the game?

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Normally, what is the goal of a game?

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Why do you play a game?

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 To win.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Right?

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 To win.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 What does it say right now in this game, in the initial set of rules?

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Does it say anything about winning?

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Do you see a rule?

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Yes.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Which one?

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 What does it say?

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Yes.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And it is in the box of mutable rules.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Right?

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 What does it mean?

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 It can be changed.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It could be 50 points.

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And think wilder.

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Does it have to be points?

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It could be anything.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Exactly.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 What could it be?

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 What would you like to have?

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You can have five alpacas.

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Or make a suggestion.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You can define the rules.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You are right.

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You can change the rules.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Exactly.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 The first person who wears a heart rock hoodie.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Could it be?

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 If you make the suggestion to change the rules and everybody votes for you, then yes, then you win.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Do you get it now?

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 What is the point of the game then?

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Yes.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 What are the points?

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Yeah.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 The rules are 100 points.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Oh, they are rules about points.

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Exactly.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They are rules of points.

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But they are in the mutable box.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Which means?

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 They can be changed.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Does the game end?

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 What do you think?

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It doesn't say now in the current set of rules.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Can it be said?

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We can change it.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Yes.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Of course.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 One more time.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 This is the bar code of the existing set of rules.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 If you want to have the reference on your device.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That is the same as what is displayed on the screen right now.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 You kind of need the device.

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Yes.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You kind of need it.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I will need some help with documenting the points.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 First of all, or do we do it on the honor system that everybody writes down their own points?

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And keep track of their own points?

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 What do you suggest?

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 What do you prefer?

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Or do you want to have a public board that I display on the screen?

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Okay.

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Which means then we will have to ask for everybody's name.

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And --

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Yes.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Exactly.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Exactly.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Yes.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Okay.

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Now, last step before we start the most awesome game of all games.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 We are going to go through all the rules we have right now.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Okay.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So this is just the rules I wrote up from also previous players.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And you have a loose set of rules that you can begin with.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And now we can -- can we read it out one by one?

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Yeah.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Muteable rules.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Muteable rules.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 You can go louder.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 All rules change proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 102.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Every player is an eligible voter.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule change.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Great.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So some terms that are a bit more formal, if you don't understand, please ask.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Okay?

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 103.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment the completion of the vote that adopted it.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Even if it is wording explicitly states otherwise.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 No rule change may have re-created application.

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 104.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank or the number or the number of the reference.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000

 David, you start.

278
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 You can either suggest to move anything from one or something to two or something from the immutable rules to mutable rules, or you can suggest a new rule.

279
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Or you can say delete one rule. That's also fine. Or you can say modify any of the existing rules.

280
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Yeah, you can say anything. Like from the 200 box.

281
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And I will make a timer because in case that you will take forever to decide, I will make a three minute timer.

282
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I will change rule 209.

283
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You will change rule 209 to?

284
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 More than 100.

285
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Great.

286
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 100? You sure? Okay.

287
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 All right.

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Yeah, so everything that comes now will start from 300.

289
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Yes, because once you change it, that one is gone.

290
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Yes.

291
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 All right. Now, remember how to get a rule passed at this stage? What do we need?

292
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yeah, we need to vote on it. And every player needs to vote on it. And we need a, what kind of vote?

293
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 A unanimous vote. We need a unanimous vote to get it passed. Okay?

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So now, let's vote on it.

295
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Who is for to change rule 209 to 100 mutable rules?

296
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Okay, we have one against it. So immediately it doesn't get passed.

297
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So yeah, another, yeah, exactly. So another rule we have is that we need to alternate in clockwise order, which gives us you.

298
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Okay, then I would like to propose to change rule 203.

299
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 203?

300
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I would like to change it to if and only if the vote is a majority. So we no longer have to, everyone agree on a rule change, but we would have to basically the majority has to vote for it, and then a rule gets accepted. So we would change to a democracy from a consent-based system.

301
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Okay.

302
00:26:44,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Correct? Is this how you want to phrase it?

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Yes, this is important. So a rule change is adopted if and only if the majority of the eligible voters vote in favor of the change.

304
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Vote, vote.

305
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Now we have to vote. Does everybody vote pass? Yes. Okay, gets adopted. Nice.

306
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Now you can roll a dice, which is here.

307
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 You can start rolling and then.

308
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Wait, what do you want?

309
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Can I roll a bigger dice?

310
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Yeah, which one?

311
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Which one?

312
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I mean I could roll a 100 sided dice.

313
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 No. Okay.

314
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And then you can say start, I'll click roll.

315
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Oh, you get 16.

316
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Okay.

317
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I didn't get, that's true.

318
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Say start.

319
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You got a three.

320
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Okay, so now we can see in the set of mutable rules, which means that things can be changed, that rule number 203 is changed to rule 2301.

321
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Now it becomes a rule change is adopted if and only if the majority of the eligible voters vote in favor of the change.

322
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And right now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight voters and players.

323
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 If we have more than four votes, then we get a rule passed.

324
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Okay.

325
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Great.

326
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Next one.

327
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 We have one more player coming back.

328
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 All right. Okay. Do you want to.

329
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Should we.

330
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 We skipped you last. Okay.

331
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Do you want to jump back in?

332
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Right. Okay.

333
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Yeah, we don't have to change the rules to allow that. We can just go ahead and do that.

334
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Yeah.

335
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Okay, now.

336
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000

340

343
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000

344
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Do you want to make a suggestion?

345
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Email. Email. Yes.

346
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 You want to create a new rule?

347
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Which is?

348
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Okay.

349
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Do we have something like that?

350
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 We do not currently have any restrictions, so this is a new rule. At no time may there be more than 15 immutable rules.

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Okay.

352
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And now vote.

353
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Pass.

354
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Okay, now we have.

355
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 So there is a rule that says.

356
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points apiece.

357
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 So that means you receive 10 points.

358
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Yeah.

359
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 But before that, we need to roll the dice for email.

360
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Wow, you get 20.

361
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Nice.

362
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And what's your name?

363
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Timo.

364
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Timo?

365
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 T-I-M-O.

366
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And you get.

367
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Do you remember how many?

368
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 10 points just by being contrarian.

369
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Correct.

370
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 So what do we do in that case?

371
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 But when you're playing, right?

372
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 So you can create a rule that states that the player is present because someone who's not present is not a player.

373
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Not eligible to vote. I guess we need to roll.

374
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 I mean, I guess we can discuss.

375
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 The team, whatever a team is, we still don't know what a team is.

376
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 But I guess we have to find what a team is, that we are also violating anything.

377
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Oh, no, we are violating this. We're just allowed to discuss something if we're teammates.

378
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 We have to find that, right?

379
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Good point.

380
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 How do we resolve this?

381
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 We don't have a rule on that yet.

382
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 A conflict.

383
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Is there a conflict if there isn't a rule?

384
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Good question.

385
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Can we?

386
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Your turn.

387
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 First, what's your name?

388
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Monica.

389
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 And Monica, it's your turn.

390
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 So based on the discussions earlier, what do other players want and what do you want?

391
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 There can be teams.

392
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 That's a new rule. There can be teams.

393
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Each turn?

394
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Each turn.

395
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 So every time a new player says something, that's each turn.

396
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 One round.

397
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 One round is one from the first player finishing until the last player and then starts again from the first player.

398
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 That will be one round.

399
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 It needs to stop until you're back.

400
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Or maybe the round.

401
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Or am I not allowed to leave it?

402
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 It means that if you're in a team, then your teammate can go in your group and get a double vote.

403
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 How big is the team?

404
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 How big is the team?

405
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Each round, everyone stays with whom he wants to be in.

406
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 So there can be more rules if there's a conflict.

407
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So you basically say I want to be in a team with you and you?

408
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Are we still discussing the problem of leaving and coming back?

409
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 No, just of teams.

410
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 I didn't make a proposal just for leaving and coming back.

411
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Okay, now you have to finalize your rule.

412
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Here, new players, if you want to join, please come over here.

413
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Yeah.

414
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 Yeah, I can put up the QR code again.

415
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 This is the QR code of the rule set with the rule book that we're going with right now.

416
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 You already scanned it?

417
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Cool.

418
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 All right, Monica, now let's get back to you.

419
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Finalize your rule.

420
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Yes.

421
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Okay, we'll leave some ambiguity.

422
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 This is how you want the rule to be?

423
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Okay.

424
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Is this the form you want to be voted upon?

425
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Okay.

426
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Now, every player, time to vote.

427
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Okay, if you vote for, please stand up.

428
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Okay, we have four votes.

429
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 No, that's not enough.

430
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I'm afraid that is not passed.

431
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 That is not passed, so.

432
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 However, who was against?

433
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 David was against.

434
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Sorry?

435
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Oh, that's true.

436
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 You're right.

437
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 It's not a winning proposal.

438
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 You're right.

439
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 My bad.

440
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Your dice.

441
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 I get 11.

442
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Your turn.

443
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 May I know your name?

444
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Hannah.

445
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Hannah.

446
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Okay.

447
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Let's see.

448
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Hannah, what have you got?

449
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 A new rule.

450
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 It's also about creating teams.

451
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Yes.

452
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Okay.

453
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 Right.

454
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 One player's team up.

455
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Okay, all teammates.

456
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I don't know how to use this keyboard.

457
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 His points double.

458
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 And their votes shall be consistent.

459
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Their votes, meaning that they have to vote on the same thing.

460
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Oh, okay.

461
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Yeah, okay.

462
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 So each teammate gets two votes.

463
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Okay.

464
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Okay.

465
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 So, Hannah, you're suggesting a new rule.

466
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 One player's team up.

467
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 Each teammate gets two votes.

468
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 And their votes shall be consistent.

469
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Must be.

470
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 Must be.

471
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Must be consistent.

472
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 Are there any questions?

473
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Confusions?

474
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 Very confused.

475
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Is there a question answered?

476
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 What is it?

477
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 What's the answer?

478
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Yes.

479
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Hannah?

480
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 Okay.

481
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 So one player's team up.

482
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 Correct.

483
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 All right.

484
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Every player, time to vote.

485
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six.

486
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 All right.

487
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 So it gets passed.

488
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 Now we have a new rule.

489
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 One player's team up.

490
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Their votes must be consistent.

491
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 And each teammate gets two votes.

492
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 Each player's voted against gets ten points.

493
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 Could you, yes.

494
00:48:42,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 Emil, do you have a question?

495
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 Good point.

496
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Very good point.

497
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Exactly.

498
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 Exactly.

499
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 That's a very good point.

500
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Yes.

501
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 Now my rule is voted on.

502
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 I can't change it.

503
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 For the next person.

504
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 Yeah.

505
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 Great.

506
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 As for the points, I think both of us, we lost our suggestion for a change.

507
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 And I think we then have minus points, right?

508
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Exactly.

509
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 You should have minus points.

510
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 So that was minus ten.

511
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 Who can tell me how to, okay.

512
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 Okay.

513
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 So if you propose a rule suggestion and it loses, you get minus ten points.

514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 But if you vote against a rule that is then decided to come into place, then you get plus ten.

515
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Okay.

516
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Yes.

517
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 So at the moment, the --

518
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 All good?

519
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Yes.

520
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Very good?

521
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 I love the rules.

522
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 Amazing.

523
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 I'm glad you love the rules.

524
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 Do you want to join the game?

525
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 Great.

526
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Our chef is going to come back.

527
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 You want to come on stage?

528
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Oh.

529
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 This one?

530
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 Yes.

531
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Okay.

532
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 There you go.

533
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 Yeah.

534
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 There are some very devoted fans for the game.

535
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 So just as a reminder that at the moment, in mutable rules, we have some rules about the point system.

536
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 One being, as Alex has suggested, that if you're a contrarian against the majority, then you are incentivized because, you know, not every -- not to say majority always have the best idea in mind for everybody.

537
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Right?

538
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 So maybe this rule is not good, and you vote against it, but it still gets passed, but you will receive ten points just because you're against it.

539
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 I have a question.

540
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Do we have a rule about when you can still change your vote so if, like, thumbs go up and you see, oh, there's a majority, you turn your thumb down?

541
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
 Good point.

542
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Maybe someone is cheating.

543
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 We don't have it yet, but you may think about it.

544
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 It's not cheating if there's no rule.

545
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Exactly.

546
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 Maybe it's not cheating.

547
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 That's very true.

548
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 Very good points.

549
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 And another rule we have at the moment about points is that 206, when a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses ten points.

550
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 And 103, right, says that no rule -- yeah, so basically 103 says that no rule changed comes into effect before the vote is completed, which basically means that you can change your vote throughout because it just changes, like, the moment the vote is done.

551
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 So the voting counts in that moment.

552
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 Yes.

553
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 So vote as late as possible.

554
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 I guess.

555
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 Shall we continue?

556
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 Shall we continue?

557
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Not yet.

558
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 Because Hannah hasn't rolled a dice.

559
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 Oh, yeah.

560
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 There you are.

561
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 We're going to roll the dice for you.

562
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 Six.

563
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 And also before that, before we proceed, the people who voted against Hannah's rule will receive ten points. That includes you.

564
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
 What's your name?

565
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 Sven.

566
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 Sven?

567
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 Okay.

568
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Sven gets ten points.

569
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 Did you vote against it?

570
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 Yes.

571
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 Okay. You also get ten points.

572
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:36,000
 Timo is a serial contrarian.

573
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 And --

574
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 It is rule number -- 204.

575
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 It was.

576
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 It was voted by majority.

577
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 It was adopted.

578
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 It's just not valid because there's a rule with a lower number that says a different thing, but it's in the rule set.

579
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 It was adopted.

580
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 Yes.

581
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 Adopted meaning that it is being part of the rules now.

582
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 No, we have six people with thumbs up.

583
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 It was majority vote.

584
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Any confusions or misunderstanding?

585
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
 Nothing against this for this turn?

586
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 Yes?

587
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 I also voted against it.

588
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 You voted against it.

589
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:05,000
 That was -- okay, let's go again.

590
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 Come again.

591
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
 You voted for it, right?

592
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 And Hannah voted for it.

593
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 And Emil, you voted for it.

594
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 You didn't.

595
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 You voted against it.

596
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 You voted for it.

597
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 So that was six votes.

598
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 And, yeah, they all voted for it.

599
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 But you also get ten points.

600
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 You voted against it.

601
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 Emil as well.

602
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 Both of you get ten points.

603
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 Okay.

604
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 Now it is Sven's turn.

605
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
 Sven.

606
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 I would like to go back to the rule 102 problem.

607
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 Okay.

608
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 Before you continue, remember there is a very fundamental rule that it is 102 is an immutable rule.

609
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
 Which means that you have to move it to --

610
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 I don't want to change the rule.

611
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 I want to create a rule that defines what a player is.

612
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 Okay.

613
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 You want to define what a player is.

614
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
 Exactly.

615
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
 Which means you want to add a new rule.

616
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 Exactly.

617
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 In a mutable rule box.

618
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 In the standard mutable rule box.

619
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 Exactly.

620
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 You have to be very precise.

621
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 I'll try to be.

622
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 Great.

623
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:01,000
 Therefore, we have rule 304.

624
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 That says a player is --

625
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 Propose a player is only a person present at the voting can be a player.

626
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Is a person present is and only is a person present at the voting round.

627
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 The vote.

628
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
 At the vote.

629
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 At the vote.

630
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 I have a question.

631
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 You can leave at any time.

632
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 But if you are not present for a vote, you will just be skipped.

633
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 You are not a player at that moment.

634
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,000
 We can't really do anything.

635
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 Technically.

636
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 Well, yes.

637
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 But it still says in one or two that every player must vote on every rule.

638
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Is there a rule that I'm proposing?

639
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 Okay.

640
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
 Any more questions?

641
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
 Sven is proposing a new rule.

642
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 Every player.

643
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 A player is and only is a person present at the vote.

644
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 Is this clear?

645
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 Okay.

646
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 Okay.

647
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 What is that?

648
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
 Okay.

649
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 Thumbs up.

650
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 Up.

651
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
 Up.

652
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

653
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
 We have seven, four.

654
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
 Yeah.

655
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 So I have ten players right now and seven votes for the change.

656
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 And you get the rule passed.

657
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
 Congratulations.

658
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
 Thank you.

659
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 You write a new rule, Sven.

660
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
 At the same time, we have three against it.

661
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 Right?

662
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 Alex and Timal.

663
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
 Serial contrarian, huh?

664
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 So you get ten.

665
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
 David get ten.

666
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
 Alex get ten.

667
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:51,000
 And now Sven, you roll the dice.

668
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 13.

669
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
 And we're going back to the rules.

670
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 Now we have a new rule that says a player is and only is a person present at the vote.

671
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 Okay?

672
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
 Good.

673
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 Now moving on to the next turn, Timal.

674
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 Finally, your turn.

675
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 What are you going to do?

676
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 A new rule, please.

677
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
 A new rule, please.

678
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
 Okay.

679
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 If players are not on the seat or not involved in the game during the voting phase, the votes will be divided equally between the two results.

680
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
 In the event of a tie, however, the votes will not be continued.

681
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
 Again.

682
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
 A little slower.

683
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:02,000
 If a player is not on their seat during the vote, then that's not a player.

684
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 The vote will be divided equally between the two results.

685
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 In the event of a tie, however, the votes will not be counted.

686
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 Your vote will be evenly divided.

687
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:23,000
 I think you have to explain it a bit more.

688
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 It does not because it is contrary to the previous rule.

689
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
 Okay.

690
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
 Oh, thank you.

691
01:02:32,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 If players -- if a player is not on their -- or not involved in the game, are not involved in the game during the voting phase, their vote will be divided.

692
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:14,000
 Will be divided between the two results.

693
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 Okay.

694
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:26,000
 In the event of a tie, however, the votes will not be counted.

695
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
 Okay.

696
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
 Do I get this?

697
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
 Does it make any difference?

698
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 Exactly.

699
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
 It doesn't matter.

700
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 Timo doesn't care.

701
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 I had no time to think.

702
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
 Timo has no time to -- you have time to think.

703
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 You can think right now.

704
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 No, you refuse to think.

705
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 Okay.

706
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
 It's different.

707
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 It's not that you don't have time to think.

708
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 You refuse to think.

709
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
 Okay.

710
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
 Timo refuses to think.

711
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 As a serial contrarian, he refuses to think.

712
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 Can he even refuse his own rule in his voting?

713
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 Being a serial contrarian, I think he will.

714
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 We can make a rule that says Timo is not allowed to vote against things.

715
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
 We totally can do that.

716
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
 You totally can do that.

717
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 I cannot.

718
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
 Is there any clarification needs to be made?

719
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
 Any questions?

720
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 Frage?

721
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 Confusion?

722
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 Dismissal?

723
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 Any -- anything?

724
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
 Okay.

725
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
 No more questions?

726
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 Shall we begin the vote?

727
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 Okay.

728
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 Let's vote on Timo's proposal.

729
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 Rule 305, if a player is not on their seat or not involved in a game during the voting phase,

730
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
 their vote will be divided between the two results.

731
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:38,000
 In the event of a tie, however, the votes will not be counted.

732
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
 Great.

733
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 All right.

734
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 The rule is not voted for, and hence we're going to delete it.

735
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
 Okay.

736
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 We can keep it in.

737
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 We can do that.

738
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 It also says rule 104 says that each rule change proposed shall receive the next integer,

739
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
 whether or not the proposal is adopted.

740
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
 So we need to keep record of the rules.

741
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 Correct.

742
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
 Correct.

743
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
 We need to keep it.

744
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 So we need to keep the number as well.

745
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
 Dice for Timo.

746
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Yay.

747
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 Yay.

748
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
 13.

749
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
 All right.

750
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 Now our new player.

751
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
 Okay.

752
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 Do you want to continue playing or do you want to -- you can make changes to the previous rules.

753
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 You can say --

754
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
 Continue to be present.

755
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 And just say you can also delete any of the rules, existing rules.

756
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
 I have an idea.

757
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 You have an idea.

758
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 Teams can be made --

759
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 Okay.

760
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
 When one person asks a yes or no question and every person that says yes is a team and

761
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 every person that says no is a team, I think it would spice things up basically.

762
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
 I think that's a different rule.

763
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
 I don't know.

764
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:19,000
 I don't think the mic likes me.

765
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
 You're overthinking.

766
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:31,000
 Point it towards the speaker.

767
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 Yeah.

768
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
 Okay.

769
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 Wait a second.

770
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 I just need -- I think this is -- the computer is frozen.

771
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 I'm just going to listen to my friend's voice memo real quick.

772
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 I'll be right back.

773
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
 You will be right back.

774
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 Okay.

775
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
 Can someone --

776
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 In 20 seconds.

777
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 Okay.

778
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
 In 20 seconds.

779
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:21,000
 Finalize the rule.

780
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 Good points.

781
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
 What is it?

782
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
 Can we form?

783
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 By asking a yes/no -- painful.

784
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
 Sorry.

785
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
 I don't know how to type on the German keyword.

786
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
 Yes/no question.

787
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 Interesting.

788
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 Okay.

789
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 And everybody?

790
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 And everybody says yes.

791
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 Okay.

792
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
 You have to talk to each other.

793
01:10:41,000 --> 01:11:09,000
 I'm not my role to get involved.

794
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
 I'm just going to ask you to talk to each other.

795
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 Okay.

796
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000

 Okay.

804
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

805
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 Okay.

1095
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
 Okay.

1096
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1097
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
 Okay.

1098
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1099
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
 Okay.

1100
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1101
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
 Okay.

1102
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1103
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
 Okay.

1104
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1105
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
 Okay.

1106
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1107
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 Okay.

1108
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1109
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
 Okay.

1110
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1111
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
 Okay.

1112
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1113
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
 Okay.

1114
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 I'm going to ask you to talk to each other.

1115
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
 Okay.

1116
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:35,520
 You voted against it again, right?

1117
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,520
 And what's your name?

1118
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,520
 Dimi.

1119
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,520
 D-I-M-I.

1120
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,520
 D-I-M-I.

1121
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,520
 Dimi.

1122
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,520
 Exactly.

1123
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,520
 Yes.

1124
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,520
 Great.

1125
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,520
 You get 10 points as well.

1126
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,520
 And Lily, you get to roll the dice.

1127
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,520
 Where did the dice go?

1128
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
 Do I close it?

1129
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
 Yeah, here.

1130
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,520
 Okay.

1131
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,520
 Say start.

1132
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,520
 Okay.

1133
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,520
 I'm going to roll the dice.

1134
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,520
 Okay.

1135
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,520
 I'm going to roll the dice.

1136
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,520
 Okay.

1137
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,520
 I'm going to roll the dice.

1138
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,520
 Okay.

1139
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,520
 Say start.

1140
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
 Start.

1141
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,520
 Four.

1142
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,520
 Okay.

1143
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:10,880
 You get four.

1144
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,920
 Any other thing I'm missing?

1145
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,720
 Who gets a point?

1146
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,720
 Okay.

1147
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,720
 All right.

1148
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:23,120
 So now we're going back to Dimi.

1149
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,120
 Dimi, you're finishing the round.

1150
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,120
 Empower.

1151
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,120
 Come on.

1152
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,280
 I would create a new rule for...

1153
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,280
 Dimi is going to create a new rule?

1154
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,120
 Team making because currently...

1155
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,840
 Not team making, the lifespan of teams.

1156
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,840
 Wow.

1157
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,680
 The lifespan of teams.

1158
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:50,800
 I think with the current mechanism of creating a team, it would be the best if a team would

1159
01:18:50,800 --> 01:19:00,920
 only be valid for one round because there are these questions.

1160
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:11,400
 The thing is these questions, 306, I don't ask if I understand it correctly.

1161
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
 206.

1162
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:24,680
 Because in 202, there stands that first a rule is proposed and then a die is rolled,

1163
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:31,280
 but not that these questions are asked.

1164
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,040
 I hope you understand what I mean.

1165
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,040
 I do not.

1166
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,040
 Perfect.

1167
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,560
 Does everybody understand what he means?

1168
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:47,560
 We didn't amend 202 yet.

1169
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,560
 No.

1170
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,600
 Could I maybe, instead of create a new rule, change 202?

1171
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,600
 Yeah.

1172
01:19:54,600 --> 01:20:04,320
 Then I would add as a first point that happens even before proposing a new rule that these

1173
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,480
 yes/no questions for the teams get asked.

1174
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,720
 Is this optional or do you have to?

1175
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,560
 Are you suggesting a change to 306?

1176
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,560
 To what?

1177
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
 306.

1178
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,560
 No, 202.

1179
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,560
 Yeah, 202.

1180
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,560
 That first...

1181
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:31,040
 Okay, so you want to move, basically you want to move 306 to 202.

1182
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,360
 Basically I want to include 306 into 202.

1183
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,360
 Yes.

1184
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,360
 That...

1185
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:46,440
 Which is different from what you said earlier about the lifespan of the team.

1186
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,440
 Yes, it's different.

1187
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,920
 I had a new idea.

1188
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,880
 Okay, you have a new idea.

1189
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,720
 Dimitri has an idea to incorporate 306 into 202.

1190
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:06,960
 So instead of making a proposal that it is a compulsory...

1191
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:20,720
 Yeah.

1192
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,840
 But then that means that...

1193
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:31,040
 I think it would be nice if it is mandatory, so you must, as the very first step of each

1194
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:39,520
 round, you must ask a yes/no question to both teams to spice it up.

1195
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,520
 To spice it up.

1196
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,400
 That's a good reason.

1197
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,940
 That's a very good reason.

1198
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:48,200
 This is exactly what the game is for.

1199
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,200
 We need more spice.

1200
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,400
 It's too bland at the moment.

1201
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,000
 I'm bored.

1202
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,680
 Okay, but that means you have to think about the consequence of that, is that each turn

1203
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,600
 there will be a new team forming.

1204
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
 Yes.

1205
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,600
 Right?

1206
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,600
 Yes.

1207
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,600
 Okay.

1208
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:17,720
 He can edit just 202, and in the edit he adds basically what's set in 206, and adds,

1209
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:24,000
 for example, the lifespan also to the things he's adding to 202.

1210
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,360
 It's part of it, yeah.

1211
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:46,600
 So one turn takes no more than three minutes, consists of three parts in this order that

1212
01:22:46,600 --> 01:23:08,920
 you first have the player at their turn

1213
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:15,840
 and generate teams by asking a yes/no maybe question.

1214
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,600
 Must generate teams by asking.

1215
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,200
 And each one must answer, and they are allowed to lie.

1216
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,720
 Each team.

1217
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:34,400
 But then you don't have to formulate the lifespan of the team because automatically at every

1218
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:54,200
 new turn new teams are formed.

1219
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:19,160
 We have a team meeting theme for our Jugend-Tek group, a small group of a few people every

1220
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:30,600
 day to this time, and then we would go away for a few minutes, a few minutes, and our players

1221
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,200
 this time, sorry.

1222
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:38,600
 Should we make an intermission of the game?

1223
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,280
 Do you want to finish your role first?

1224
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,760
 Yes.

1225
01:24:42,760 --> 01:25:03,680
 So first you have to ask a yes/no question to generate a team.

1226
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:16,440
 Then the original steps of 202 would come proposing one rule change and having it voted

1227
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,360
 on.

1228
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:32,040
 And then the throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one score.

1229
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,600
 Yes.

1230
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:42,360
 That would be the new proposal.

1231
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:48,560
 Okay let's vote.

1232
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:58,520
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1233
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,120
 Okay your rule gets passed.

1234
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:09,760
 Great so now we have 202.

1235
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:17,720
 This gets written over.

1236
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:41,880
 Okay.

1237
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:48,160
 Okay now shall we continue or do you want to break?

1238
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
 Continue?

1239
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,160
 Vote?

1240
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,160
 Vote?

1241
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,560
 We need a majority vote for this.

1242
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,760
 Do you want to continue?

1243
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:04,320
 Or we need a unanimous vote for this?

1244
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,720
 Yeah like the game is on pause right now.

1245
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:13,280
 A ten minute break.

1246
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,360
 We'll meet here at ten two three.

1247
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,080
 Okay we'll meet back here at ten two three.

1248
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,240
 The slot is until four.

1249
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:28,200
 The slot is until four.

1250
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,800
 Until four.

1251
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,080
 Until four.

1252
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:43,880
 But my suggestion is that now we take a ten minute break and when we come back please

1253
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,400
 spice up the game.

1254
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,800
 Right I think Lily has a very very good point.

1255
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,320
 That it has to be fun.

1256
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,440
 Yeah okay.

1257
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:19,920
 Alright I do I can check here.

1258
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:20,200
 Yes.

1259
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:20,640
 Okay.

1260
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,080
 Okay.

1261
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,800
 Okay.

1262
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,000
 Okay.

1263
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,600
 Okay.

1264
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,920
 Okay.

1265
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,040
 Okay.

1266
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:41,720
