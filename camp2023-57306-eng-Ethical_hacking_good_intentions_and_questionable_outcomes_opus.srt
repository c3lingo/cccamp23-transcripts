1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,880
 So welcome everybody.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
 This is my first time at CCC Camp.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
 Is it someone else's first time as well?

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
 Yeah.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
 Good for us newcomers.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,120
 I thought this topic is kind of good for this camp,

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,920
 but I also have a video next which has music at least

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 that is good for this camp,

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,560
 but it's kind of relevant to the topic.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,320
 So I thought I would play it.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,120
 Let's see if we can get it to play.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
 Hopefully the Wi-Fi works and we can get it to play.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,880
 It's essentially a very old ad that very old people like me

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
 and others who are old like me will recognize.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
 So let's see.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
 Do we get sound?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,520
 We got sound when we tested.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
 But it's the you wouldn't steal a car.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,760
 The privacy campaign.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
 You wouldn't steal a bike.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
 You wouldn't steal the purse.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,080
 You wouldn't do that and that.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,440
 It had really good music.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,960
 So too bad.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,800
 It's if someone can do some beatboxing right now,

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,760
 that would be helpful.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:56,560
 Was that a pig beatboxing?

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
 Nice try anyway.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,960
 So since we're talking about ethics, this whole campaign

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
 was essentially about not stealing a car

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,120
 and like privacy is a crime.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,760
 But then someone on the internet was like,

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,880
 well, I would maybe download a car if the owner could keep the car.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,840
 So that would be kind of ethical and that would be kind of okay, I guess.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
 How many here would download a car?

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
 Quite a few.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,660
 Thank you.

40
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,760
 Okay, so to get started on this topic of ethics,

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,840
 hackers kind of work in sometimes in peculiar domains.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,680
 So sometimes we're going on the boundaries of law and so forth.

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,320
 So I thought I would take you through my short version

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,320
 of the evolution of the hacker ethics as you would know it.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,160
 And this goes back even before my time.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,920
 It was like in the 60s, 70s when computers started being more common.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,800
 Hackers would essentially be doing all kinds of things

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
 on these computers that were not really accessible to everyone yet.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,680
 And they kind of went through this stage where they had this,

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
 the hacker ethic.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
 There was a guy who wrote a book

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
 and Richard Solomon, which is considered the last true hacker,

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,320
 said about ethics in that book like this,

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,720
 that the hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,840
 to the ethical ideas this community of people had.

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
 That knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,280
 and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,440
 And I think probably quite a few of us can stand behind that statement.

59
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:02,480
 Also, the hacker ethic can kind of be summarized into, in that era,

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,080
 exceptional single mindedness and determination to keep plugging away

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
 at a problem until the optimal solution had been found.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,640
 Our well-documented traits of the early hackers,

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,040
 willingness to work right through the night on a single programming problem

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,120
 are widely cited as features of the early hacker computer culture.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,600
 Who here has spent an entire night figuring out a problem?

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,160
 Okay, quite a few.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,080
 So you can also consider yourself early hackers in a way.

68
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,400
 And then when we go a bit further, maybe to the 80s,

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,080
 things started shifting, there started to be sort of more...

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
 The ethics started dwindling maybe a little bit more.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,480
 There was some white hat, black hat stuff going on in the 90s as well.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,200
 There started to be a little bit more of a divide

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,760
 and people started going to jail for doing criminal stuff, so black hats.

74
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,880
 And there started to be more like a divide of white hats and black hats.

75
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,960
 And the hacker manifesto was written by a guy called the mentor.

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,280
 And essentially his statement in that manifesto is that

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,080
 this is our world now, the world of the electron and the switch.

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
 The beauty of the board, we make use of a service already existing

79
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,360
 without paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons.

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
 And you call us criminals.

81
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
 We explore and you call us criminals.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,440
 We seek after knowledge and you call us criminals.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,800
 So it's more like a hacktivism kind of freedom to all information and all data kind of era.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,160
 And then to kind of sum up the...

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
 Or to get back more to today.

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,040
 Today we have sort of...

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,120
 We don't really have these clear-cut maybe books.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
 Well, we do have some books, but...

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,360
 At least for me, working in this industry,

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,560
 I don't really come across that many ethical sort of statements and things like that.

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,640
 Some of them we might see in ethical hacking certificates,

92
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 but they're very sort of rudimentary.

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,880
 Don't test without permission.

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,640
 Don't be an asshole.

95
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,960
 Don't break shit and steal stuff and so forth.

96
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
 And those are kind of okay, but...

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,400
 I feel like there should be maybe a little bit more.

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,240
 And some of the bug bounty platforms,

99
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
 because I work with bug bounty as well,

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,600
 some of the bug bounty platforms have these kind of code of conduct.

101
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 So they have like, you know, you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that,

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,960
 you know, respect others, you know, and things like that.

103
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
 And don't go out of scope.

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
 And scope is kind of the limitation where companies in bug bounty programs,

105
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
 they say, "You can test this, but don't test this."

106
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
 And then someone goes and tests this, and then what should happen?

107
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,000
 Sometimes not much.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,600
 So this was kind of the super quick background of hacker ethics.

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,280
 And what really got me into this talk was the...

110
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,520
 kind of the things that I've seen recently that made me think,

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
 "Okay, maybe we should have even more discussions about ethics

112
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,400
 when it comes to security testing, and especially in the bug bounty

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,640
 space where I work a lot."

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,880
 And if you're not aware of bug bounty, it's essentially security testing for a reward.

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,640
 So you do some testing, and you send in a report through usually a bug bounty platform,

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 and the company will pay a reward based on how severe the issue is.

117
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,840
 And some of the things that I've seen will kind of touch upon both security testing

118
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,160
 and the bug bounty area, because that's what I know.

119
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,480
 So probably there's much more sort of things that go on,

120
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,280
 but these are the things that I thought I would share with you,

121
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,920
 because it might not be that well known, some of them at least.

122
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,560
 But we'll start with the really simple ones.

123
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,240
 You're testing with permission, and then you bring down some servers.

124
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,080
 It's probably happened to a few, maybe here.

125
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,800
 Has it happened to any of you?

126
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,080
 Yeah? Okay, a couple.

127
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,400
 I see my colleagues over there as well.

128
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:57,040
 We've done this, unfortunately, quite a few times, and it really boils down to,

129
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
 maybe we should have done more due diligence.

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,520
 Maybe the computers that we were testing were in a broom closet somewhere,

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,800
 or it was like a Raspberry Pi that really couldn't handle many requests,

132
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,520
 so it just cannot handle anything automated, and it just dies.

133
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,920
 So we're not really doing a service for the customer

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
 or the individual that we're testing, and probably not anyone else.

135
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,800
 And it's not really nice getting a call from the client saying,

136
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
 "Oh, you brought our servers down. What are you doing? Stop doing whatever you're doing.

137
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,160
 It's not cool. Our production is down."

138
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
 And then you find out their production is running on potatoes,

139
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
 so that's also a good finding in itself.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:50,480
 All right, so now for the more gray area of the things that I have seen recently.

141
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,520
 Someone popped the champagne, and that's great.

142
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,800
 And I have introduced this arbitrary Gandalf the gray scale.

143
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,760
 Some of you might not see it, but depending on how gray I believe it would be,

144
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,640
 there's a number of Gandalfs in there to represent how gray this thing might be.

145
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,800
 So let's get started with the first one.

146
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,840
 So the first one kind of goes from the first example we had,

147
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,520
 testing without permission and then bringing down servers, for example.

148
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,600
 I would give it maybe like one Gandalf.

149
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,760
 I mean, it's kind of like, yeah, and in some cases,

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,160
 it's maybe not that legal as well in some countries.

151
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
 You know, you're not really allowed to test without permission.

152
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,080
 So I'll give it one Gandalf maybe.

153
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,360
 Then the other one is stumbling across a vulnerability without permission,

154
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,880
 but then you kind of notify the target company through, for example, your local cert.

155
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,440
 And the local cert in many of our European countries especially

156
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,120
 protect the hacker from the company if they want to pursue you as a hacker.

157
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
 So they protect you as an individual as well so you don't get pursued

158
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,520
 because it's a cert contacting the company.

159
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,040
 I'll give this maybe like one Gandalf, maybe not even a single Gandalf,

160
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
 maybe a hobbit, I don't know.

161
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,720
 And then we have this really awesome thing,

162
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
 testing without permission and then blackmailing the target.

163
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,760
 Reward me or else something will happen.

164
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
 Someone will hack you.

165
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,960
 It's not me, but here's my full name.

166
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:44,000
 A lot of times, we've seen these types of individuals contact companies directly

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,360
 and saying like they have a terrible vulnerability and it's really critical

168
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,680
 and you need to pay me right away.

169
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,240
 And then when you start asking, okay, what is this vulnerability actually?

170
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
 Then it's like, okay, well, you have a file that shouldn't be there.

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,960
 It could be really almost nothing and they want a reward for it.

172
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,760
 Sometimes it could actually be something, but you don't really know

173
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
 until you get into this super annoying conversation.

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,360
 Usually, it's almost like spam or like a scam where they really like try to get you.

175
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,240
 They might send the CEO of the company this email and they scramble all the jets like,

176
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
 whoa, something is going on and it's not really good for business either.

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
 So it's quite interrupting as well.

178
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
 So you're not really benefiting anyone, I would say.

179
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
 I'll give it one, maybe two Gandalfs.

180
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,000
 And then there's a new really cool trend, marketing trend,

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,480
 where you test without permission with your super awesome service

182
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
 that finds vulnerabilities.

183
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,840
 And then you send an email to the company saying,

184
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,400
 my super cool service found hundreds of vulnerabilities in your company.

185
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,800
 Let's meet up and have an online meeting and talk.

186
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,520
 So they're trying to sell it to you and it's usually,

187
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,320
 like there's a different scale of how aggressive they are.

188
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
 Some of them are very aggressive.

189
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,520
 Some of them might, for example, contact everyone in the organization

190
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,840
 to try and sell this service that they have.

191
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
 We've seen it.

192
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,360
 It's really cool and it really doesn't get you any sales,

193
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
 at least if you contact us.

194
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,000
 But for some it might work.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
 I would give this maybe one Gandalf, two Gandalfs,

196
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
 depending on how aggressive it is.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,080
 And then another really nice trend that we have seen recently

198
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,840
 is that you purchase stolen credentials off the dark web

199
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,040
 and then you ask the company to give you an award.

200
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
 So they submit it to a bug bounty program.

201
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,080
 So maybe they found the credentials of one of your employees,

202
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
 maybe it's an IT admin,

203
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,440
 and then they submit it to a bug bounty program in hopes for a reward.

204
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,200
 And in their submission, they say, I purchased these off the dark web.

205
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
 Okay, well, if you're a company, it's like,

206
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,360
 if you say that, we can't really reward you

207
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,960
 because that's not legal to buy stolen stuff.

208
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,480
 Normally, companies can't do it.

209
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,760
 Some do it anyway, and some have been known to pay for them as well.

210
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,440
 I know some, I'm not going to name names,

211
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,080
 but it has been happening.

212
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,240
 And the rewards have sometimes been pretty substantial.

213
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
 I'll give it maybe three Gandalfs, maybe four.

214
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,720
 One of the issues that I see with this is,

215
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
 obviously, there's a meme if you can't see it,

216
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
 it says the secret ingredient is crime.

217
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,520
 So if you're not very good at hacking,

218
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
 maybe you can go to the dark web and do this.

219
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,160
 But one of the issues that I see with this is that

220
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,680
 there's a sort of basic thing with how markets work in general.

221
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,520
 So if you, let's say, everyone starts doing it

222
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,360
 because it's very profitable,

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,480
 then we have a huge demand for stolen credentials coming in.

224
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,200
 All the ethical hackers of the world want to buy stolen credentials.

225
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,720
 And then the criminals are going like,

226
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,280
 oh, shit, we have a huge demand.

227
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,080
 What should we do?

228
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,120
 All right, let's increase the criminal activity

229
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,720
 so we can get some more supply.

230
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,080
 And then the supply and demand cycle just,

231
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,800
 it just starts going.

232
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,720
 And, yeah, I don't know.

233
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,920
 It's kind of a bit of a problem, I would say, to do this.

234
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,920
 Maybe later, some of you can discuss how ethical it really is,

235
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
 and is it really an ethical hacker kind of thing to do?

236
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,080
 Then, to take this a bit further,

237
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,600
 is maybe, I don't know if you know,

238
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
 but there are services that you can subscribe to

239
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,080
 where you can purchase stolen credentials of the dark web.

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,960
 Oh, sorry, the service purchases the credentials for you from the dark web.

241
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,920
 So it's kind of like a Netflix of crime, you know?

242
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,360
 So it's like, okay, I'll just subscribe to this service

243
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,120
 and I'll get all the stolen credentials.

244
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
 So I don't know, maybe,

245
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
 what if you had a Netflix for stolen cars?

246
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
 Would you subscribe to that?

247
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
 I don't know.

248
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
 But this is kind of,

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,000
 I mean, it gets a little bit more difficult

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,280
 because now you're just,

251
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,920
 you're not buying the credentials yourself,

252
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
 but you have a proxy that's buying them

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
 and you're subscribing to the service.

254
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,560
 And there's multiple services like this.

255
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,280
 Probably, some of you know,

256
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,960
 if you want to use them, don't ask me.

257
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,760
 But yeah, I would give this maybe three gandalfs

258
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,040
 on the gray scale.

259
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,640
 And of course, when they do both these things,

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,920
 they submit them to companies running bug bounty programs

261
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,200
 in hopes of rewards.

262
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,080
 So yeah, that's great.

263
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,200
 And I kind of like to always take a step forward

264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
 and go in further.

265
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,520
 So what if you exploit the Netflix of crime

266
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
 to get those credentials

267
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,320
 and then submit that to a bug bounty program

268
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,440
 in hopes for reward?

269
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,160
 I give it maybe five gandalfs

270
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
 because it kind of goes like even further.

271
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,480
 So you're doing a crime on a service

272
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,800
 that is doing, well, buying stolen stuff

273
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,680
 and selling that as a subscription.

274
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 I would give it maybe five gandalfs.

275
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,640
 What do you think?

276
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,280
 Yeah, maybe.

277
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,640
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

278
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
 Yeah, maybe keep your enemies close, I guess.

279
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,920
 Then I saw a new trend popping up lately.

280
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,520
 We've all known of credential stuffing in general

281
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,280
 as an attack used by criminals.

282
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
 But ethical hackers in the bug bounty scene

283
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
 have started using it as well.

284
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,320
 So they take leaked credentials off the web

285
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,800
 and then they try it on everything.

286
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,000
 And if it works, then they submit a report

287
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,720
 to the company in hopes for a reward.

288
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,240
 And I don't know, maybe not that great,

289
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
 but should you really, usually in the policies

290
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,800
 of these bug bounty programs, they kind of say

291
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,440
 like you're not maybe allowed to do this kind of things.

292
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
 Maybe you're not allowed to get credentials

293
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
 for certain things.

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
 But then if you take it from some leaked dumps online

295
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
 and you use that and check if they work,

296
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
 maybe, I don't know, could be.

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,760
 Maybe a little grayish, maybe.

298
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,560
 I'll give it maybe four, three Gandalfs maybe.

299
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,800
 But then there's purchasing stolen credentials

300
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,840
 of the dark web and using those for credential stuffing.

301
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,960
 So it goes again a step further.

302
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,080
 I wonder what the next step after this would be,

303
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,960
 but I guess we'll find out pretty soon.

304
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,360
 But I would give this maybe five Gandalfs

305
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,480
 because let's say ethical hacker purchases credentials

306
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
 of your company online.

307
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 Then they take those credentials.

308
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
 They don't give it to you yet.

309
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,040
 They're just going to test if it works everywhere.

310
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,680
 And then if it works, which it might,

311
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,520
 then after that and after gaining access

312
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,160
 to a certain system, maybe it's really bad, right?

313
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,280
 They go into that system and then they also check

314
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,800
 what they can access in that system, of course.

315
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:35,520
 So it kind of goes maybe a smidge too far in some cases,

316
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,320
 I would say.

317
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,280
 I would give it five Gandalfs maybe.

318
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:49,520
 So just to kind of, because there was some secret ingredients

319
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,800
 in this presentation and a lot of them

320
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,120
 had to do with crime, I was thinking that I would kind of

321
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,400
 just quickly go through the legals of Finland

322
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
 because I'm from Finland.

323
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,720
 So if you purchase stolen goods, regardless of how much it costs,

324
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
 you can get up to one year and six months of jail time.

325
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
 And in Germany, you get five years or a fine.

326
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 Germans, it's like what?

327
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,120
 Or a fine, like what does it depend on?

328
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,160
 I don't know, but maybe you guys probably know

329
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,120
 what it depends on, but...

330
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,320
 The judge, okay.

331
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
 So if you're good buddies with the judge,

332
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,120
 you only get a fine.

333
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,720
 Yeah, probably it's also depending on how severe it is

334
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
 and so forth.

335
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,600
 In Canada and US, if the values exceed over $5,000,

336
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 so let's say I run a bug bounty program,

337
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,280
 someone gives, they've bought stolen credentials.

338
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,400
 They want me to give them a reward.

339
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
 I'm a US company.

340
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
 I give them a reward over $5,000.

341
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,680
 I've committed a federal crime.

342
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:06,240
 This may or may not have happened.

343
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,920
 I may or may not know and I may or may not say anything.

344
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,560
 In Canada, you can get up to 10 years in prison.

345
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
 Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,080
 The company is committing a crime by paying a reward

347
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
 to somebody who has stolen the credentials.

348
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:43,520
 Even if they're your own clients?

349
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
 Yeah, there is some differences if it's your own,

350
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
 but it depends on the legal.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
 I'm not a lawyer, so maybe consult a lawyer.

352
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
 Don't listen to me regarding legal stuff.

353
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
 Or well, the basics, you should know that it could be a crime.

354
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:11,440
 And I think at this camp, I already saw an Italian lawyer

355
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
 on stage at one of the lightning talks.

356
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,120
 So he probably knows a bit more than me about the legal stuff.

357
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,840
 But since some of this is like a little bit gray area,

358
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,520
 or maybe not, and some of it might be criminal,

359
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,800
 or maybe not, I'm not sure.

360
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:36,000
 But what I'm thinking is that also because maybe some of these stolen goods

361
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
 or like stolen credentials, they're too accessible.

362
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
 Maybe that's also a part of the issue.

363
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,480
 Like you can just subscribe to this Netflix of crime

364
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,560
 and like get your crime feed into your inbox.

365
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,720
 So maybe that's part of the problem.

366
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,280
 I'm not sure.

367
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,840
 It's not that difficult to go on the dark web and buy credentials,

368
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,680
 stolen credentials, or stolen anything, really.

369
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,280
 Maybe it's just too accessible.

370
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,840
 So maybe in some cases, for example, the ethical hackers that are doing it,

371
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,000
 maybe they're not just thinking too much about the ethics of it all.

372
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,680
 They're just doing it because there's a reward at the end.

373
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:23,120
 Another kind of issue that we've seen in the bug bounty scene especially

374
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,920
 is that you hold on to vulnerabilities in the pursuit of rewards.

375
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,440
 So essentially, you have maybe a cool vulnerability

376
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
 that you've discovered yourself.

377
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,560
 You're not going to share it because then others might use it

378
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,600
 to get the rewards.

379
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,400
 So you want to make sure that you've collected all the rewards

380
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
 from all the different companies.

381
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,920
 And I'm not sure how ethical that is.

382
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:54,880
 I forgot to put the Gandalfs here, but maybe a couple of Gandalfs on that one.

383
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,240
 Essentially, the hacker ethics from the early days at least

384
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,920
 was to be open and share.

385
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,560
 And I personally, I believe in that being a good thing.

386
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,920
 But I can also understand why they would want to hold on

387
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,160
 to certain types of vulnerabilities if it's in their own benefit.

388
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,760
 Obviously, everyone has hungry mouths to feed, including their own.

389
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:26,880
 Another issue that I've seen also is it kind of goes into the ethics

390
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 of bug bounty as well, is that in a lot of cases,

391
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,280
 the bug bounty programs, they define a policy.

392
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,000
 You define a policy, you're allowed to do this and that,

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
 and go so and so far.

394
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 But the company themselves, for example, they pay the researcher

395
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,280
 or the hacker, the ethical hacker, based on the impact of the finding.

396
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,120
 So in some cases, even if you have these sort of arbitrary limitations

397
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,840
 from policy, the hackers might have an incentive to actually go further

398
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,520
 to increase the impact of the vulnerability so they can get a higher reward.

399
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,560
 So there's kind of like a dilemma in this issue because it's like,

400
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:19,120
 in theory, you shouldn't, but if you do, you might get a higher reward.

401
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
 So maybe you should, but should you really?

402
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,920
 And it really kind of plays back into the ethical boundaries

403
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,560
 of that particular hacker, how far will they go?

404
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:40,800
 And we've seen cases of ethical hackers dumping databases and going even further.

405
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:47,280
 So I don't know how many Gandalfs this one should be,

406
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,320
 but maybe both the hacker and the company should get a few Gandalfs for this one.

407
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:03,040
 And then, of course, there's secret techniques or open sharing.

408
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,960
 Some prefer to have their secret techniques and keep them to themselves

409
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,760
 because there's more rewards for them.

410
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,240
 Some prefer to share everything.

411
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,960
 And I guess one of the reasons I wanted to talk at this camp

412
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,160
 about these issues as well is that there's probably a lot of you that

413
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,840
 also are interested in discussing these things and seeing where this should go.

414
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,680
 And I don't know, in my opinion, it would be better if everyone would share,

415
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,320
 but some people prefer to keep some techniques to themselves.

416
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,520
 So what is then actually ethical hacking?

417
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,680
 I mean, there are some boundaries.

418
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,600
 Some of them are legal, but some of them, even the legal boundaries,

419
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
 are not that well known.

420
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,640
 There might be also different types of boundaries,

421
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,600
 depending on the country that the company is in and also where the hacker is in.

422
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,800
 So it might be difficult to sort of set the boundaries even legally

423
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,440
 because it depends sometimes.

424
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,000
 So what should the boundaries be?

425
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,360
 And who should define them?

426
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,400
 What is ethical hacking?

427
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,440
 And how can we as a community improve on these issues?

428
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:37,600
 And I guess the final question, what does your moral compass look like?

429
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
 In which direction does it point?

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,680
 Are you a white hat, a black hat, or something in between, or a mix of them all?

431
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,960
 And I guess this presentation was a lot faster than I was planning on.

432
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:01,200
 So in case you need to find me later, you can find me at the Salmiaki Village in Cold North.

433
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,760
 There's my contact details, and apparently I was too fast.

434
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,160
 Apparently I was too fast.

435
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,600
 Thanks Joachim.

436
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:28,080
 It looks like we have about 15 minutes for questions.

437
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,480
 If there are any, are there any questions from the internet?

438
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,520
 None? Any questions from the audience?

439
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
 Please line up over there by the microphone.

440
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,220
 Thank you.

441
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:45,780
 Hi, I'm not an expert whatsoever.

442
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,300
 I'm a total movie, so this question might be a little bit stupid.

443
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,700
 But from what I understood, you considered the interest of the people being hacked,

444
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,620
 and the interest of the people who were hacking.

445
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
 What about the greater good?

446
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,940
 What about people who are not related to the company, not related to the hacker?

447
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,500
 Like everybody, isn't that a very relevant question for whether it's ethical or not?

448
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,340
 Does it benefit everybody, what I'm doing as a hacker?

449
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,060
 Or does it worsen the situation for everyone?

450
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:24,020
 Yeah, I mean, and it also depends.

451
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,060
 Does it benefit everybody, or a large amount of people, or a few people?

452
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,300
 It's a difficult question really to answer.

453
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,660
 I don't really have an answer, I guess.

454
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,180
 Yeah, it's ethics.

455
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:48,020
 Hey, you focused on the legality a lot, and on, you know,

456
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,660
 let's call it technical hardcore hacks.

457
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,900
 But some of the stuff that you had, where is it with credentials?

458
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,100
 And just yesterday we had a cool presentation by Kirilis,

459
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,700
 I don't know if he's there, on social engineering.

460
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,340
 And I mean, you know, the most obvious kind of social engineering is super duper direct,

461
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,420
 and then it's fairly in your face, and okay, you've got the credential, that's it.

462
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,500
 But once you go for the higher value targets, usually you start to build up networks,

463
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,740
 and it's human level trust that you have to build with a lot of people

464
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,940
 to build your network to actually get at the whale that you're aiming at.

465
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,780
 And then you betray those people.

466
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,740
 And that can have real psychological impact on those people.

467
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,020
 We had a really cool discussion after the session yesterday with a bunch of friends.

468
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,740
 This is not something I see discussed a lot in ethical hacking, you know,

469
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,100
 the psychological impact on, oh, fuck, I trusted that guy.

470
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,460
 So what are your thoughts on that?

471
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,500
 Yeah, that's right.

472
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,500
 Betraying trust can be very detrimental, like, regarding the person's mental health.

473
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,420
 And we also see, for example, a lot of people that are victims to cybercrime also,

474
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,100
 they suffer greatly sometimes.

475
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,740
 So in some cases, I think we should maybe have some like victim health care,

476
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,660
 like the cybercrime health care station or something.

477
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,900
 I don't know what that would look like.

478
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,060
 But it's very difficult for people mentally, especially if they're,

479
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,340
 for example, the entry point to a bigger event, then it's very hard on them.

480
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,740
 Once it dawns on them that this really was serious.

481
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,900
 So yeah, there's a lot to improve on that area as well.

482
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,580
 Any more questions?

483
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,220
 Maybe just a comment.

484
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,580
 What you just talked about is what's called a second victim in safety literature.

485
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,900
 Like the pilot who is like, you know, like the plane crashed, right?

486
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,980
 Let's say some people died.

487
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,380
 Like, it's not good, but it's not really the pilot's fault.

488
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,940
 Almost never, like very rarely.

489
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,620
 But they feel really responsible and sometimes commit acts against themselves.

490
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,500
 Let's just put it that way.

491
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,380
 So actually, in general, security, I think, would benefit a lot from safety literature.

492
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,740
 But that's a different discussion to be here.

493
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,580
 All right.

494
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:18,500
 So that's one more question, it seems.

495
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 What's the revenue?

496
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 Revenue who does the service is 6.8 million last year.

497
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,660
 I work for a big enterprise.

498
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,780
 This is private.

499
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,500
 So how do you feel about that revenue number?

500
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,260
 6.8 million.

501
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,100
 Revenue.

502
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,420
 What?

503
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,900
 Sorry.

504
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,100
 Spy cloud.

505
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:52,180
 The service enterprises subscribe to get essentially leaks, dumps, credits of their own input?

506
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,380
 Yeah, that's one of the services that you can subscribe to.

507
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,980
 I mean, I'm not sure how ethical.

508
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:08,020
 There's also other sort of cyber threat intelligence related companies that provide stolen credentials, etc.

509
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,620
 It's gray area.

510
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,020
 Yeah, I don't know.

511
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,540
 That's, I guess, one of the questions I also have.

512
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,260
 Like, I'm not sure what's right and what's wrong.

513
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:36,740
 So probably more discussions are needed to find the boundaries and what's right and what's wrong.
