 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Good morning to the Mini Bear stage, to the opening session on day four.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 It's nice of you to be so early and attend this session.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We will look into the past for present dangers.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Welcome Richard for peeking over the tape mode.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Wonderful, thank you. And thank you all for being here indeed this bright and early.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Enjoy the shade while it lasts.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So yes, for the next 20 or so minutes I will be speaking about magnetic tape storage.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 The title of this talk is Peeking Over the Tape Mode.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So the idea is we'll be spending half the time looking at how modern large-scale magnetic tape storage systems work.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And then the second half we'll be looking at what this implies for the security.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 The motivation behind this talk is that we're storing more data now than ever before.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And still in this sort of ecosystem of various storage media, tape is still a very central pillar.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 At the same time, tape is taking on a dual purpose, besides being a cheap and efficient way of storage.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 It's also becoming a sort of safeguard against many cyber attacks that are happening against organizations.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 For instance, ransomware, where tape is an important protector nowadays.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So before we proceed into the details, why should you listen to me?

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't have this, you know, the long gray beard usually associated with your local tape wizard.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Instead I've worked with magnetic tape for only two years, but I've had the pleasure of doing so at CERN,

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 the European Center for Nuclear Research, where I've been, well, in the IT group, specializing in it.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 This, of course, warrants a small disclaimer.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It's not a way, shape, or form organized by, approved by, or associated with the CERN, the organization.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 This talk does not represent CERN's moral values. This talk is my own.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So, no.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Yes. Why are we speaking about magnetic tape?

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Magnetic tape is still very important for data storage.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And the data on magnetic tape is oftentimes very interesting.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 There's a bit more of an overhead usually to using these tapes compared to your disk, which you just plug into your PC.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And so people tend to be, you know, curating the data that is on the tape.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Tape storages may include, you know, important data that you want to keep for future generations,

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 you want to keep it for the next decade or so.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It may also include personal information, you know.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Odds are your government is using tape archives somewhere in their storage ecosystem.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 As do, you know, your friendly hyperscaler cloud providers,

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 either through services which are directly exposed to the customer or in the back,

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 where they keep their, you know, the personal data they've accumulated over the decades.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There's also backup data, you know.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 If you want to do a backup, we're better to put it than magnetic tape storage,

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 which lasts for longer than the life expectancy of a hard drive,

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and where it is less accessible to mean hackers.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Tape is also becoming popular again because it is less bad for the environment.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 It has a lower impact both energy-wise and for the whole life cycle of the tape and the related infrastructure

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 than spinning disks or other tape storage systems, or other storage systems.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So there is a sort of push to use more tape in various institutions because of its environmental friendliness.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And then, as I mentioned, tape is becoming this sort of last line of defense against ransomware attacks.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Data written onto a magnetic tape cartridge is, in this state right now, inaccessible to an attacker.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So if your ransomware attack is going on and you make this thing hard to get to,

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 then you have data that is safe from the whole thing.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And, well, it's not just that this is a nice thing for organizations to have as a protection.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's also becoming mandated. So here, for instance, for the European Digital Operation Resilience Act,

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 the DOOR Act, it makes it a requirement for financial institutions to have the appropriate safeguards in place in their system.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And then magnetic tape will be one of these.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Finally, magnetic tape is still storing a lot of data at the end of the day.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Just to hammer this home, here I have some... there we are.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Just an estimate from back home at CERN how much data will be needed.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So here we see, for the Atlas experiment alone, you just need to look at the y-axis.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You see that we are looking at the exabytes, units, for the coming decade.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Times this by more experiments, by more institutions which will have even higher requirements,

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 we'll be in set-abytes of data storage.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And so we need to be efficient and scrape all the bits or put all the bits on media where we can.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So what does a magnetic tape system look like?

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 At scale or at medium-ish scale, it looks something like this.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There is data input on the left side, where the data first hits what we call a disk buffer.

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 This is because tape can be fiddly to interact with and most external systems know how to deal with disks instead of tape.

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So a disk buffer is a nice interface for those.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Then the disk buffer servers will be speaking the protocol, the transfer protocol that you want to use.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They'll be an intermediate buffer for both data going in and out.

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And then that makes the whole operation smoother.

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's generally a bad idea to write to tape systems directly through the Internet.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So this is a nice buffer that smooths things out.

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 However, this is a filthy disk system, so we won't be speaking about it anymore.

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So for the rest of this talk, we won't dedicate more time to it.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 After the disk buffer, the data goes to the tape server and the tape drive.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 The tape server is the intermediate for connecting a drive to your local IT system.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So it'll be connected to the Internet or the local network at least.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It will have the appropriate drivers.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It will have some disk storage as well to also buffer the files going in and out locally.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And then it will have the tape drive connected somehow, usually as a SCSI device and by way of fiber channel for the data transfer.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 The tape drive is responsible for writing to these things.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So as you may note, in a normal hard drive you have both your storage media and the reading infrastructure in one unit.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 For tape this is not the case.

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So the drive is a separate I/O device.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 A tape drive is housed within the tape library and as are the cartridges.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 The tape library is a container. It can have many shapes. It can be round. It can be container shaped.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And inside of there you have shelves of these magnetic tape cartridges and the drives for reading.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 In addition to that you have some robotics for moving the cartridge to the drive and getting them into contact.

88
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And yes, so now we can look at these components a bit more in detail individually.

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The media.

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The media or tape cartridge is what in the end stores your data.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It is, if you open one up, well it's a plastic container and inside you have this wonderful tape all coiled up,

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 which is composed of magnetic media and some polymers to keep it all together.

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 The media comes in two flavors, Enterprise and LTO. Enterprise is the more expensive option, usually a bit more feature rich and more capacity rich.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And then LTO or Linear Tape Open, which is a more open standard by the LTO consortium.

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's usually more focused on cost effectiveness, so a bit cheaper, but you get more bang for your buck.

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Around this time, the time of writing or speaking, a tape cartridge of the present generation holds about 18 to 20 terabytes of data each.

97
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And it has this nifty property that this doubles every couple of years.

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So whereas your disk storage at this time is sort of struggling to scale because it has reached its paramagnetic limit,

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 where the bits are becoming so small that it's really hard to keep them magnetized and to have the technology around it to actually magnetize more stable media,

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Tape Media still has lots of easy victories ahead.

101
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 The bits are relatively big in contrast to disk or optical storage, but it makes up for that by virtue of having a big surface area.

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 So the band inside the tape cartridge is one centimeter wide, but one kilometer long, which gives it a lot of surface area to work with.

103
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 This however introduces a cost in that it may take time to seek to your files.

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So we'll get back to that. So once you actually have the drive mounting the tape and are reading or writing it, it takes some time to get to where you want to go.

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 The media may be formatted, similar to how you would format a disk file system.

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 The baseline sort of is the LTFS file system where your tape is sort of like a disk file system with all the metadata attached.

107
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But at scale you will find lots of systems which don't use this.

108
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 This means that the metadata such as the file name will not be on the tape itself, which also has implications.

109
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Moving on to the tape drive.

110
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 As mentioned, it's the input/output device used for reading and writing tapes.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 These also come in the flavors of Enterprise and LTO, Enterprise being more feature rich and LTO being more bang for your buck.

112
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And also they come into shapes. They come in full height and half height.

113
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Full height is the sort of standard size that you would put into your tape library.

114
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And half height is the sort of smaller desktop or desk sized edition.

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It can go up to 400 megabytes per second, about there about at present.

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But this is under ideal conditions. If you write your data stupidly and you need to seek back and forth, you will of course incur a great cost to your read times.

117
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 The drive is connected to the tape server as mentioned. This is also known as the data mover in the lingo.

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And yes, connected by SCSI.

119
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 The drive is capable of performing encryption and compression.

120
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Which makes it nice so then you don't need all that hardware in the tape server. You can offload that to the drive.

121
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 What does writing to tape look like? It's something like this. This won't be on the test, don't worry.

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 You mount a tape drive onto your tape server. You get these ST0, ST1, NST0, NST1 and so forth devices showing up.

123
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 These are your destinations or your ways to interact with the drive.

124
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 For bigger systems you would then have some sort of command to get the correct cartridge from your library to your drive.

125
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And then you can operate it on it using actual tools or Linux tools which may or may not already be present on your machine.

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Fun fact, TAR was used to interact with tape storage.

127
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The MT command is maybe not installed on your laptop but it's easy to install on most distros.

128
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 This allows you to interact with the drive, to read its status, to load tapes into an active state and so forth.

129
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Yes.

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Do note for the two devices, one of them rewinds, one of them doesn't. So once you have written a file to your tape, STX will go back to the start of the tape.

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So if you go, I'll write my file number one, thank you. And then later on go, I'll write file number two, it will overwrite the first one. So beware.

132
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And then there are some more examples on Red Hat site and on IBM's pages for more details.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 The library, very quickly done. It's the physical container.

134
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 The library maintains the air gap between the reading and writing device.

135
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 This is what gives you this nice property of defense against, for example, ransomware attacks.

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 The attacker has more troublesome time getting to your storage than the disks which have to be connected all the time.

137
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 There may be robots inside, usually one. There may be two for redundancy.

138
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And these, together with the rest of the internals, all communicate by way of CAN bus or ethernet, depending on the model of library.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Very important, a library may be partitioned into logical libraries, similar to how you would partition your disk.

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So a logical library would show up to your software as a separate library to interact with.

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 So then you can split your physical one into multiple logical ones which is useful, as we will see.

142
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Alright, finally, security, the part you've been waiting for. What does this all mean for the security of the tape system?

143
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Overwriting takes time. As we've mentioned, seeking takes time, getting to the right place, also just getting the tape from the library to the drive takes time.

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 There's usually a queuing system because you have not so many drives in contrast to how many tapes you have.

145
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So it's a system of patience. You may have to wait a day to get to your data.

146
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Conversely, the deletion process is not as you would expect it, perhaps.

147
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You may know that on a disk you may delete a file and then it's still like someone scraping the data from the disk and after the fact may recover it, depending on how you've actively been writing.

148
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's similar on tape. Usually the deletion process is just a metadata operation.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So wherever you keep your metadata is where you just do the deletion and you don't actually touch the tape.

150
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 That means the data is still on the tape. So if someone steals the tape after the fact, after you thought you deleted everything, data might still be fine.

151
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 To remedy that, it's important, use encryption by default on your tapes so that if someone runs off with them, they still can't read them.

152
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Also use this key management system called Leather. I don't have the time to go into the details, but it's basically a neat way to organize encryption keys so that you can on a more fine-grained level delete files by just deleting encryption keys, which is then compliant with, for example, GDPR and other data management systems.

153
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Also be sure to wipe and destroy used tapes. Don't just throw them in the trash. Someone might be able to recover them.

154
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 In addition, if you overwrite the start of the tape, your data may be completely gone.

155
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I mentioned this NST0 and NST, these devices which may rewind and not rewind.

156
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 If you by accident go, "Oh, I'll write my 18 terabytes of data and now I'll just add another file and whoops, I wrote them to the wrong device. It's now at the beginning."

157
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 You've overwritten the tape. The data is no longer accessible to you because these tracks on the tape media don't line up.

158
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 They will no longer line up and so without special equipment you will not be able to read any successive data on the tape without special equipment,

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 which you can get to you by your local three-letter agency or which you will have to ask your tape manufacturer or distributor for, which is usually a costly operation.

160
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 An attacker may exploit this by very quickly just overwriting as many tapes as they can, so be aware of that.

161
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It just takes the time to queue in the system, the time to mount the tape into the drive and then just to write a few bits.

162
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Remember to protect yourself against that by restricting access, of course, as much as possible.

163
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Monitor access patterns, so log and monitor the log files for suspicious activity.

164
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Is someone mounting 2,000 tapes in my library and just writing the first bits? That's odd. Beware of that.

165
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Also, put in logical libraries with read-only access.

166
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I mentioned these partitionings, these logical libraries. You can put, for instance, replicas of your tapes.

167
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 If you have data on one tape and you want to be really sure that it's safe, you create a double copy.

168
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Put the replica into one of these logical libraries, which in the tape library does not have a drive associated with it.

169
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Then you suddenly have a separate partition where the data cannot be easily read from or overwritten.

170
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Tapes can be moved in between usually by way of special administrator commands or command line tools.

171
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I believe REST APIs are on their way as well, so this will be the way to protect against sudden overwrites.

172
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 The patient attackers encryption key switch attack.

173
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Tape is often used for backups where you will have to encrypt for your users.

174
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 A patient attacker can compromise a host and then just wait, observe.

175
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Then they may switch the encryption keys if they find them.

176
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Maybe you have put the encryption keys onto a file on disk or you have put the encryption key into a database.

177
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 The attacker can switch it. Just, you know, they look at the cron job, they see the backup starts at 1.45 each day.

178
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 We switch the key just before and just after so that the backup takes place with the wrong encryption key.

179
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Do that for the duration of the data retention policy and then suddenly if an incident happens,

180
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 if an attacker pulls the switch on the ransomware attack, then the backups are inaccessible to the horror of the system administrator.

181
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So to remedy that, try to outsource key management to your users.

182
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It's nice to not centralize everything in your tape service to the best of your abilities.

183
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 If the software you use for the backups allows the user to manage the keys, that's great.

184
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Also monitor, of course, make your users take samples of their backups, read them back,

185
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 and do the same yourself for the case where you manage the keys.

186
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And then finally distribute your architecture.

187
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 If you don't make everything central, then it is certainly easier to avoid attacks on these files.

188
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Finally, one more. As we mentioned, you may have tape which is not self-describing,

189
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 so your metadata may not be on the tape. What does this mean?

190
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It may mean that the metadata is on a central database somewhere.

191
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 The central database is a very juicy target for an attacker.

192
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 So remember to back it up and make sure you are not keeping the backup of the database.

193
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 If you are speaking to your local database guy and ask him what's your database policy,

194
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 don't worry about it, we put it on tape, they will say.

195
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And if your tape is then not self-describing, you will not be able to recover in the time of an incident.

196
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So that puts me at the end. To conclude, it's good to understand tape systems

197
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 because they are still part of our mix of data storage media.

198
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Attackers may understand these by just observing, so you should understand them too.

199
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And then I move on to questions. You can ask me questions here,

200
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 or later on I will be at the Cold North area most likely,

201
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and I have about ten of these souvenir CERN LHC tapes for the interested people to claim.

202
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Thank you for listening.

203
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Thank you, Richard.

204
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Okay, there's a microphone. One or two questions.

205
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Thank you for your tape and for a blast from the past, which I understand is also the future.

206
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 You talked about an act, a European act, that requires using tapes,

207
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 which is a nice thing because tape is a great media that has been forgotten.

208
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 However, do you know if large companies have actually started implementing it and going back to tape?

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I think they never left tape actually.

210
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Sorry to hear that. You should tell your management about the security benefits.

211
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But tape is for sure used still at scale.

212
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I know that CERN used to be big players in the market back in the day.

213
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Now we have been sort of eclipsed by the hyperscalers.

214
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Before we were the big buyers for the vendors of tape, IBM, the producers of our Sony and Fujifilm nowadays.

215
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But the use of tape has probably never been greater.

216
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 It's just that as more people move to the cloud, I suppose they implicitly use it through the cloud services more and more.

217
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Of course, maintaining a tape system by yourself is hard.

218
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 There's lots of proprietary software around.

219
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And robots keep breaking.

220
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Exactly. And you have to take responsibility for the breakage.

221
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 We're trying to reduce the cost somewhat by, well, we develop our own open source software for the data management on tape.

222
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So this reduces the cost of running it yourself.

223
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But yeah, I see for medium sized companies it can be tough.

224
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Thank you Richard for your view on our tape storage solutions.

225
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 One more time?

226
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 One more? No.

227
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Alright. Speak to me after.

228
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Thank you all.

229
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 [Applause]

230
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
