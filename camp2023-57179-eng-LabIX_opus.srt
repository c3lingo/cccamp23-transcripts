00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello and welcome everybody to the Nordic Stage.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hafnum, who's a university student who's studying cyber technology,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 is going to talk about how to make a difference in the world of technology.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hafnum, who's studying cyber technology, is going to talk about how to found an internet exchange

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 he founded LabX from his HackerSpace, Labitet and Copenhagen.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Welcome with me, Hafnum.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Thank you. I would like to tell you about how we created an internet exchange in my local HackerSpace.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 First, why I'm making this talk.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 As a newcomer to the networking world, network routing and similar,

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I found it really difficult to find good information on IXP operations.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I could read some things from some network operator meetups and some of the commercial internet exchanges,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 but it was really high level, so everything was a bit difficult to understand on what is it exactly.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Also, when you need to get an AS number and other IP resources delegated,

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 there is some administration and it differs from region to region.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 In Europe, it's ripe and there are some policies that they have.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So, what is the LabX internet exchange?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Well, it is a community run internet exchange in Labitet, in our nice little HackerSpace in Copenhagen.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We use it as a place to learn network routing.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 It is a very difficult topic to get started in.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 There are some projects that can help you, like DN42,

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 but if you want to do routing where you talk with the real world and not via VPNs,

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 then you need to pay a lot of money to get into a data center

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 or find some project where it is available for you, also closely nearby,

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 that you can actually start doing network routing and bring a small server, perhaps.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So, yes, you can learn some BGP. This is where I learned my BGP, at least, in our HackerSpace.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 You can play with our router server. It has its own nice AS number.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 You can get started in getting IP resources like AS numbers and IP addresses.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 You can play with BGP security. This is one of the things where it is really difficult to actually get a grasp on,

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 unless you start playing with it.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 There are some really nice talks around the world about RPKI and filtering strategies.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But if you also want to actually try it, it is kind of difficult to get outside your own home lab.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Also, very soon we will change it to 9K MTU. The default in the world is 1500 MTU.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 There is an expert of C-draft for how to change it.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 As soon as I get all the way through that and I notify our members, I will change.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 We will also get that. It has a few advantages compared to 1500.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So, what does your HackerSpace need to have an Internet exchange?

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 You need a friendly uplink. Maybe you have multiple. That would be very cool.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 That is because if they do not necessarily like you, it is very hard to update your policies.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Their own policies that allows your IX clients to be announced to the world.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So, having a member that works in your uplink really helps.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But maybe be good friends and give them a beer. Some people you know.

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 You also need some server housing. You need a rack. We have a used rack.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 They are available in multiple places. We also have a used layer 2 switch.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 That is the one marked with my better drawing.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 You need at least 3 peering clients. This is the magic number of getting anything done.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 When you talk about an IX, Bright requires it.

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 P-ingDB requires it. The IXP database requires you to even be registered.

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Or consider having an entry in each of their databases.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Of course, this is also a HackerSpace. You need to have more than one person.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Because when a person stops coming to the HackerSpace, it will die.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 That is the usual thing with community run projects.

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Of course, you need to have some documentation and have some people who like to run this.

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 What is an Internet Exchange? The very simple version is a VLAN on a layer 2 switch.

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Then we have a few of connector networks.

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That is operators with their own AS number and prefixes.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 This was the difficult part. If you don't know much about networking.

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 This was a bit of a large step to have.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But if you know what I talked about, this is what you needed.

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 All these 5 slides.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But let me explain the Internet a bit.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It took me years to understand the Internet. I am still learning a lot.

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 To newcomers, let's explain some things.

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 How do you do Internet routing?

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I assume you know some networking like IP addresses.

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You get your IP prefix allocated. You find the host facility.

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 You install your machine. Then you set up your external BTP routing daemon.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 That can come in proprietary and open source solutions.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You need to find some peers to connect with.

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 We will find a transit that allows you to connect to the rest of the Internet.

71
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 If you are located in Copenhagen, how do you have a connection to Berlin?

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You need a direct fiber to some place.

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Some companies do this as their business.

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Profits, I guess.

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Let's set a scenario.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 You are an eyeball ISP in Copenhagen.

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 An eyeball ISP is you have customers with eyeballs that consume content.

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That could be watching their favorite movies, for example.

79
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 You need to get content from the content providers.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 The people having the movies.

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You need some IP addresses for customers and servers.

82
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 To be able to be reached from the Internet.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You also need some server housing and some fibers around.

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I won't go into that.

85
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 This is the nicest image I found yet.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 This is an example of networking.

87
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Some peers and transit providers.

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Don't bother with the names of them.

89
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 You can have, for example, AS number one in the total left side.

90
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They have some prefixes.

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 They can be announced up to the uplink via the next one in the line.

92
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Which then in turn is announced further.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 This is called a transit because you don't have a direct connection to everybody else.

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 It also goes the same way.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 You get traffic from everybody else.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 An autonomous system.

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 The best description I found was in an Internet standard.

98
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 It says a connected group of one or more IP prefixes.

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 One by one or more network operators.

100
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Which has a single and clearly defined routing policy.

101
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I'll get a bit more into the details of that.

102
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 One or more network operators and you have some prefixes.

103
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 An autonomous system is identified by a unique 16 or 32 ASN.

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 An autonomous system number also called ASN.

105
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 We use it to say hello, I'm AS 211153.

106
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 That's my personal AS.

107
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 If you look that up, you can find out what my routing policies are.

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Also what addresses do I have.

109
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 A routing policy, this is the simplified version, is that we have some objects called Internet routing registry.

110
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 We have them in our local regional Internet database.

111
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Like RIPE in our case.

112
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 At least in Copenhagen.

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 These could say that these IP prefixes should be disneyed to me.

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And I would accept prefixes disneyed to and from my business customers.

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 AS something something and AX something something else.

116
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 This is pretty much it.

117
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 There's other details you can go into.

118
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Very simplified.

119
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I accept that the people or the organizations behind me can be announced through me.

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Also I have included when I found a lot of good readme tools, I have included in the bottom.

121
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 You can find my slides on the program page.

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 We also have peering and transit as I mentioned.

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Peering is that we agree that we only send traffic distance to each other.

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You have prefixes here, I have prefixes here.

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 You have some content and I want some content.

126
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 We have a direct connection to each other and we peer.

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 This is most usually free.

128
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 There's a small asterisk that costs some things to pull a fiber in the data center.

129
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Many data centers take a monthly fee for having a cross connect as we call it.

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And of course you also need to buy your own optics and things like that.

131
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 We also have transit.

132
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 This is the people who like to transport traffic from you to other networks.

133
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Also the other way.

134
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But it costs something per megabyte.

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Sorry, megabit I wrote.

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And of course we would like to avoid this as much as we can.

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But again we can't be connected to every network in the world.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So this creates a little of a dilemma on where should we actually connect.

139
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Who should we peer with? Does it really make sense to connect with this small provider?

140
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Do we actually want to pay for our part of it?

141
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 We have the Internet Exchange.

142
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I will get back to that question in a small second.

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 The Internet Exchange is that we would like to keep local traffic local.

144
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 This is the main reason.

145
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Because when you have transit providers you sometimes get the issue of having the trombone effects.

146
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I included an image here where it says this is a map of the United States.

147
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Some of it.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And we have three cities here.

149
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 We have Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York.

150
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 The traffic goes from Los Angeles to San Francisco. I hope you can see the arrows also.

151
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 But it does not go directly.

152
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It goes all the way to some good amount of kilometers to San Francisco.

153
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 This creates latency.

154
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 This isn't just unnecessary.

155
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It may be just because your transit provider doesn't have a direct connection between these two cities.

156
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Or maybe they made a routing mistake. That happens.

157
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So we get lower latency if we are directly connected to each other.

158
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 An Internet Exchange also makes it more easy to connect to other networks.

159
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I always said the recurring cost of data centers.

160
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 The simplified topology of an Internet Exchange looks kind of like this.

161
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 We have this mystery meet me room as we call it.

162
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 We have some providers.

163
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There is also a cloud service down here.

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It will probably be a content provider.

165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 We all have one connection into our meet me room.

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Instead of having connections to each other all the way.

167
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 This is mostly how it looks.

168
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But there are some other things about Internet Exchanges.

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I would like to explain a bit on some of the characteristics.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 First we can have our bilateral peering.

171
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 It is called also many to many.

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Where I connect to each and everybody I would like to peer with.

173
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But instead I go to multilateral.

174
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I have one connection to a route server.

175
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That makes sure I can connect to the other ones.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 As everybody else does.

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 We have this central point.

178
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You can of course have low balancing and similar things.

179
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It is not a single point of failure.

180
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 The very simple version of this is that you have one machine in here.

181
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 The route server is for aggregating our control plane traffic.

182
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 We don't send our traffic over the route server itself.

183
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 We make sure the routes can be distributed by the route server.

184
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The advantages of this is that now we have lower maintenance.

185
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 We don't need to necessarily have a lot of injuries with each and every peering client.

186
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 We can connect immediately to newcomers.

187
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 If we have this small network that would like to connect with me.

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And I don't necessarily want to pay the cost.

189
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We can connect immediately with each other.

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 As soon as they jump on the route server.

191
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Given that I am also present.

192
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Then traffic does flow.

193
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So we don't have to go through the transit.

194
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 We can also have some debugging tools.

195
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And actually see more of what is going on.

196
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 The image shows how you can do it.

197
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Of how it happens.

198
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Our route server looks like this.

199
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It is a very small machine.

200
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It is also a very small space.

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It is like a thin client.

202
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It uses 6 watts of power.

203
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We chose this because we had it in our hands already.

204
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It is not that powerful.

205
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 It can run Debian.

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It is fine I guess.

207
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 We use the config parser called a route server.

208
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 To configure our route server.

209
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 This is where we keep the list of our clients.

210
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Then we generate the config that BERT uses.

211
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 BERT is the program actually getting the routes in.

212
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And distributing the routes to our peers.

213
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 As well as clients can also use BERT.

214
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 It is a general purpose routing daemon.

215
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It is totally fine.

216
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 You can use it as a route server.

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But you can also use it as a client.

218
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I use it as a client as well.

219
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Server hosting.

220
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 For our case we have our project called Labicolo.

221
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 It is our co-location facility.

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 It is intended for small embedded devices.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 We use it for APIs and APUs.

224
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 This is due to power restrictions.

225
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We would like to keep the cost low.

226
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 This is hobby projects.

227
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 We don't necessarily need beefy servers.

228
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 They are also readily available.

229
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Not that expensive to have.

230
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Again, this is the same picture I used.

231
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It looks awful.

232
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 We have this Cisco SK300.

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 We use it because it was already there.

234
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Again, it is free.

235
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 You can also do Mac port filtering.

236
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That is one of the requirements.

237
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 One of our peering requirements.

238
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 To avoid loops in the routing.

239
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You can make it more pretty than we have.

240
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 You can also clean it up a bit more.

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Our peering policy.

242
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Every exchange has a peering policy.

243
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Just like you as a network provider.

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 You also have some policy.

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I only want the traffic you mean to go to me.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I don't want my neighbors traffic necessarily.

247
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I do want my neighbors traffic.

248
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But you have to pay.

249
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This is based on the local Internet exchange.

250
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Peering policy.

251
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 It looks very much like it.

252
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 We allow the infinite frames.

253
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 IPv4, IPv6 and ARP.

254
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 That is the usual suspects.

255
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 We do not like proxy ARP and OSPF.

256
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And other kinds of these.

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 We only want to know BGP stuff.

258
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 We want routing and we want data traffic.

259
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 We don't want a lot of...

260
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Let's for example say DCP.

261
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 But we only allow one kind of routing protocol.

262
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 BGP.

263
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You could use other ones.

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But the Internet in general uses BGP.

265
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So it makes things much more easy.

266
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Again the MAC address filtering.

267
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 We also do not like that...

268
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 If you connect via VPN we need the full MTU.

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You have to be physically present.

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 This is not a virtual Internet exchange.

271
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 These also exist to play around with network routing.

272
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 They are fine.

273
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I have nothing against them.

274
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 But for our case we wanted to have machines physically located.

275
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Virtual Internet exchanges have the issue of...

276
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Now you are depending on transits to somewhere.

277
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And that transit can take a long time.

278
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Still a nice place to learn if you are interested.

279
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 So an Internet exchange client can also have their own policies.

280
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Here is a very high overview of how they are listed.

281
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Of some categories.

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Open is...

283
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 We just like peering with everybody.

284
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 This is when you hop on to the route server.

285
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 We have the lecture where you will talk with us first.

286
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And we are usually open to this.

287
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 We may have our own internal protocols that deny us this.

288
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 This is where you do direct peering connections.

289
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And set up a separate entry for each and everyone.

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 You can also have restricted.

291
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 This could be a transit or a very large network.

292
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 They have some security policies or similar that restrict them.

293
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That means you have to contact them and maybe you need to be a large entity.

294
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 To be considered.

295
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I have seen this issue personally.

296
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 With some large providers not necessarily wanting to peer.

297
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Even though a network provider did want to peer.

298
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It didn't make sense to buy transit.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 How do you get Internet resources allocated?

300
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I have this image of a cake.

301
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 IANA owns all the Internet addresses in the world.

302
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You don't necessarily own the ones.

303
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 You just get them allocated.

304
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 This is the regional Internet registry.

305
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 There are five of these in the world.

306
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Spread out through our world.

307
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 This is RIPE in our case.

308
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Then we have the local Internet registry.

309
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 From what I can understand, a RIPE specific thing.

310
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 As an end user, you don't talk directly with RIPE.

311
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 The local Internet registry talks with RIPE for you.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 If you want to be part of the RIPE NCC, you can pay the fee.

313
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 For a project, it doesn't make sense.

314
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 It is for network operators or people who like to pay some money.

315
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 It is not cheap, but it is not that expensive.

316
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 As a network operator, that could be an ISP or content provider.

317
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You want your addresses to be globally routable.

318
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 This is where I say I have this content and you have your customers who want this content.

319
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 The traffic should go through the Internet.

320
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I should be able to send traffic to you.

321
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Then you can handle it from there.

322
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 If everything is requested to me, I need an IP address.

323
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 A source IP address to send it back to.

324
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 This is where the routing takes over.

325
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 If you have an ISP, you don't necessarily need to have globally routed IP addresses.

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 The reason you don't necessarily need it is that you just need to have a unique identifier

327
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 for your Internet Exchange members for their own routers.

328
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 You don't want it to be mixed up with anybody else in the world.

329
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 This is why you request some IP addresses.

330
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 It is not for hosting servers.

331
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I didn't explain the cake.

332
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 IANA has all the addresses.

333
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 RIPE gets a little piece of the cake.

334
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Then your local Internet registry gets a little piece of that cake.

335
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Then you get a tiny piece of the local Internet registry cake.

336
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 There are a lot of addresses in the world.

337
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 This is only illustrative.

338
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 It is fine.

339
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I use /24 for a lot of things and /48 prefix for a lot of things.

340
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 We also have the RIPE database.

341
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 The object you need to create is an organization object.

342
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 If you already have one for your HackerSpace, this is one thing I did wrong.

343
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 We already have an organization since we do some BGP routing and announce our members.

344
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 You should just use your existing org object.

345
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 If you don't have one, you should create an org object.

346
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 You also need maintainers.

347
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 This is a list of people that get access to change your routing policy.

348
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Then a person is a person.

349
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 You also need a...

350
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 At least it is optional.

351
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 A normal client, a network operator needs ASSETs.

352
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 This is where your routing policy lies.

353
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 You don't need it for an Internet exchange.

354
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 It is recommended if someone filters for these kinds of things.

355
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 This is where we look into are you allowed to announce XYZ prefix.

356
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 XYZ is a number, not a prefix. That is called a route object if you want to tie a prefix and an AS number together.

357
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I couldn't find any of this. It was just a thing I learned.

358
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 You need to give the name of your Internet exchange.

359
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 They will ask you if you want a route server as soon as you say you want an Internet exchange.

360
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Then you say yes, but then you also need to have some...

361
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 There are also some requirements.

362
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 For a route server, you need an AS number.

363
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Your peers need to connect to the route server.

364
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 This cannot be a private resource.

365
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 One thing is that you should request a 16-bit AS number.

366
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 They are available if you ask directly for them.

367
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 We are running out.

368
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 By default, you will be assigned a 32-bit AS number.

369
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 It does not matter in most cases if you just take your Linux machine and put it up.

370
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 However, if someone brings a really old machine, they do want a 16-bit AS number.

371
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 They were just not set up for 32-bit, so it won't work.

372
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 A bonus is that a Danish number plate also fits on a 16-bit AS number.

373
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I have really been considering buying one and putting it up on our rack.

374
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Stupid things.

375
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Then you will also be asked if you need prefixes.

376
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Then you say yes, please.

377
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 So, RIPE does not give IPv4 addresses out to be globally routed.

378
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 There is a long, long waiting list.

379
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We have been exhausted the IPv4 space for a long time.

380
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That is why you say yes, this is not to be routed.

381
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 This is specifically to be announced within our pre-regulation.

382
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 This is the actual message I was sent.

383
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I said yes.

384
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 You should give these printers already and they will do pretty good.

385
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Also, what size do you want of addresses?

386
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 You have to confirm that your COLO facility actually has connectivity.

387
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I guess it makes sense.

388
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 I just didn't think of that.

389
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I had to scramble and ask three people where this is.

390
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 A few days later, I could get hold of it.

391
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 A lot of delays you can actually avoid to get hold of your contract.

392
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Again, the magic number was three customers.

393
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 If you have more than that, you are good.

394
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 But if you have less, then you need one more.

395
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 If you have two people, you can peer with each other.

396
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 It doesn't make sense to set up all these and all the administration.

397
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 They don't need to be connected directly at that time you set it up.

398
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 They need to agree and say yes, I will definitely join as soon as I can.

399
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 We also need to give the postal address.

400
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 The address is apparently able to receive mail and then a contact person.

401
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Their organization and phone number.

402
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I was just casually writing emails, so I didn't really think of these.

403
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 But they are pretty good pointers.

404
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 How do you find a local internet registry?

405
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 You ask your local network wizard.

406
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I have a few, not that many, but they know the magic of the internet.

407
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 This is also where I got pointed to the free transit project when I got my own AS number.

408
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 It's a nice project from Open Factory.

409
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 There are some really nice people behind it.

410
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 There are also people behind it that are on this camp.

411
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I hear there will also be an internet exchange by some of them.

412
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Run on the camp soon, hopefully.

413
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Yes, I have a bias that I personally know some of them.

414
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 But if you want to find a local internet registry service,

415
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 you hop into your search engine and you search for that term.

416
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Some people are happily taking your money to facilitate this.

417
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 It doesn't really cost that much to get started.

418
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 For me it was 25 euros, personally.

419
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 It's fine.

420
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 If it's another project, then you need to...

421
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 If it's a commercial actor, then you probably need to pay a bit more.

422
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Similar projects are all the community-run internet exchanges in the world.

423
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 There are commercial actors, many.

424
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 But a lot of the internet exchanges are just some networking people meeting over a beer

425
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 and saying, "Yes, we need this."

426
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And they made this.

427
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 There's also some hosting facilities.

428
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 KoloKlo in Amsterdam, that's case-based, a commercial rack.

429
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Then we also have a VGP.WTF in Warsaw, HackerSpace.

430
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Regional Learn in Berlin also exists, and also can provide some VGP things.

431
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 This is not internet exchanges, but these are places that do network routing.

432
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And may also have some people that can point in the right directions.

433
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I have probably missed a lot of nice projects, but this is the ones I found.

434
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I would like to say thank you to my collaborators.

435
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 This was actually a school project.

436
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 I managed to get ECTS points for it anyway.

437
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Olivia and Daniel, we have created this together.

438
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Then we also have Jowe from Street Transit Projects, who really help with all the right things.

439
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 It was a whole new land for me.

440
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And then we also have Asperon, my local network wizard, for sharing a lot of knowledge and a lot of pointers.

441
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Here are some good resources.

442
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 I found PNGDB and BGP tools.

443
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 I use them almost every day.

444
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 I would encourage you to go to your local network operator meetup.

445
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 In Denmark it's called DKNOG, and in Germany it's called DENOG.

446
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Lots of nice people.

447
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 You can meet a lot of nice people, and usually if you say I will buy you a beer,

448
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 then they will explain the whole thing to you on whatever subject you want.

449
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 We also have the RIPE Academy.

450
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 This really helped me in understanding IPv6 and BGP security.

451
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 They are actually pretty nice.

452
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 You can also get a certificate if you want.

453
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 That costs some money though.

454
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 But you can take the courses for free.

455
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 That's a bit more. We have the Network Startup Research Center.

456
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 That's also helped me.

457
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 We have NLNOG with their PNG, BGP Filter Guide, and NLNOG Ring for search.

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 How does the internet reach you?

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Then we have Eurex with their B-Cops and their wishlist on what to buy.

460
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 The $1000 Internet Exchange presentation on how shitty hardware can you buy.

461
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 It turns out we can buy really shitty hardware, from my experience.

462
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 If you want to find us, we actually have a self-organization called BGP Enable Hacker Spaces

463
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 at Shell 4 here at 17 today.

464
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 You can also meet me at Bornhack Village and also at Bornhack next year.

465
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Or you can meet us in Labitat.

466
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 We would very gladly talk to you.

467
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 We also have a website.

468
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 We have a PNG DPA entry, of course.

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 If you want to write an email, throw it at me.

470
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 If someone is interested in sponsoring this, I paid everything out of my own money.

471
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 It was doable, but I'm a student, so money is limited.

472
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 We very much like stickers.

473
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 That is a huge shortage.

474
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Perhaps a second uplink on hardware.

475
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 The next thing we want to look at is...

476
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 I should definitely look at getting up a looking glass.

477
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Participants can see how it works, how their routing happens.

478
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 It's a small Internet exchange, so ARP is not that large right now.

479
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 It's not a problem right now, but it can become a problem.

480
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 There's a lot of ARP broadcasts when you have Internet exchanges.

481
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 We need more documentation.

482
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 I would like to set up RPKI relay.

483
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 I've set it up personally, but not at the IX.

484
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 We have already filled our own uplink, so it's not that much of a problem.

485
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Thank you for listening.

486
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 This was my talk.

487
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Hopefully there are a few questions.

488
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Exactly.

489
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Some time for Q&A.

490
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 If there are any questions, please put your hands up.

491
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 I'm going to repeat them for the audience online.

492
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Yes?

493
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Just a second.

494
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Thank you so much.

495
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 The peers you're peering with, are they located in the same building?

496
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Or are they having a fiber directly to you, or a wavelength on a fiber, or how do you connect to your peers physically?

497
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Let me spool up a tiny bit.

498
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 If you look up in the imaginary north of the image, there are all the machines.

499
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 They're all connected by... Yes, they're physically present.

500
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Everybody has a APU2, Raspberry Pi, or small machines that are physically present.

501
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 So your peers are only in the same building?

502
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Yes.

503
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 So you're not peering with other networks?

504
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 No, that would be very nice, but it's also a small project.

505
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Next question.

506
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Do you know of any DIY internet access providers or hosting providers in Denmark that you could peer with or connect with?

507
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Network providers?

508
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Most are happy to peer with you, given that you're present at a place they are present.

509
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 If you go to one of the larger data centers in Denmark, most definitely yes.

510
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
