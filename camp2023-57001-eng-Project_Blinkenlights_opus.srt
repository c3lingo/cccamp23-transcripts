00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,640
 Okay, let's start.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,760
 Welcome this evening on the Bits and Bäume stage for

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,200
 our last talk for this day.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,640
 I'm sure you're all familiar with Blinkenlights and

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,160
 who doesn't love Blinkenlights, you know?

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,000
 That's why we're all here in the end.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
 So I think I don't have much to introduce to do.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,360
 Just want to say please give a warm welcome to Tim Pritlove,

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,240
 who will give us a very thorough insight on the project

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,280
 Blinkenlights.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,920
 Your stage.

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,160
 >> [APPLAUSE]

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,800
 >> Hello, hello, hello.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,880
 I hope you do not know the project already with all its in and

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,320
 outs, but let's make a check.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,760
 So who knows in general what I'm about to talk about?

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,240
 >> [LAUGH]

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,640
 >> That's by far too much.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,200
 [LAUGH]

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
 Who has seen the first one?

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,000
 Who has seen the second one?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
 Uh-huh, okay.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,840
 Who knows about the third one?

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,240
 [LAUGH]

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,000
 All right, okay.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,440
 So I'm going to talk a bit about the project.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,560
 So there might be some duplication to your knowledge,

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,280
 but I think it's worthwhile looking back a bit and

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,520
 trying to have a slightly different view on

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,880
 what happened because it's also about failure and what didn't happen.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
 [LAUGH]

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,280
 Because that's what comes with every project.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,240
 So project Blinkenlights, where did it all start?

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,920
 It was a crazy idea that popped up in 2001, and

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,400
 it was kind of related to the death of Wau Hollad,

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,840
 who died in 2001 in May, 2001.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,280
 Which was a disaster for us because we all expect him to be there when

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,760
 the CCC has its 20th birthday, which was coming up in the September of that year.

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,640
 And he just decided to quit early, which was quite bad.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,840
 So we had to come up with a new idea, and we thought, okay, so let's do a party.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,840
 Somehow, and in a way, that's how we found our way to this project,

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,000
 which was just beginning with the idea of having a party.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
 And in the end, it all got more and more complicated.

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,400
 So here's an overview of what has happened in this project.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,000
 So in 2001, we had this first installation in Berlin, and

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,800
 we didn't really expect anything to happen out of this.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
 But there were quite some implications.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
 It's a bit bad that the sun is shining directly on the screen.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,560
 I hope you can somehow see something.

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 2002, we had the second installation in Paris.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,160
 And six years later on, we had another installation of this large scale

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,200
 type in Toronto and Canada.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,560
 And of course, we had a tiny presence here at the camp this year.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,360
 That's basically what happened.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 So let's look back to the Blinkenleis project.

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,680
 So as I told you, it all started with this idea of having a party.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,800
 And the idea was having a party actually in this building,

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,320
 Hauses Leras, which at that time was totally empty.

61
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,800
 It was in use before, because it was like this crazy concept of

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
 Zwischennotzung in Berlin.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,840
 So they didn't know really what to do with it, so

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,560
 they threw in all those artists who lived there for quite some time.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,400
 And had their crazy projects.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
 And when we came to the empty building and

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,600
 looked if this is a good venue for a party, we found out it wasn't because

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,360
 it was stinking of all those parties that have already happened the years before.

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
 So that was not an option.

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680
 The new owners of that building also own the BCC Conference Center

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,720
 next to this building, which was also home to the Chaos Communication Congress for

72
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
 many, many, many years.

73
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,560
 But not at that time, because it was about to be renovated in 2001.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,600
 So they decided, why don't you do your party over there?

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
 It's much nicer and doesn't stink.

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,840
 So okay, we said, okay, fine, why not?

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,000
 And everything got a bit bigger and bigger and bigger,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,680
 because there was lots of space to fill.

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,600
 So we had this huge cupola that we had to fill with a party.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,840
 And there was this space around it, which we had to fill with something.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,560
 So we came up with, well, then let's do an exhibition too.

82
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,240
 And so on.

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,680
 This all happened five weeks before the date.

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,720
 And somehow I had this idea of using those windows even for

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,760
 the party already just to write CCC on it with lights.

86
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,160
 Because it's a pixel display, why shouldn't you write something on it?

87
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,240
 And that's one of those moments where your life takes a turn somehow.

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,640
 Because I just dropped this idea in a group of people.

89
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,360
 And the first response was, well, then you can start playing Tetris on it, right?

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,040
 >> [LAUGH]

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,080
 >> Yeah, and that was this freeze moment

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,040
 was like, hmm, what if?

93
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,160
 And of course, five weeks later, we had this project.

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,440
 And as you might already know, it was quite interactive.

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,760
 So we coupled it with a telephone system, and

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,120
 it was possible to play pong on it with a mobile phone.

97
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,080
 Which at that point in time was rather innovative.

98
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,520
 There have been other installations like this.

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,680
 Actually, one year earlier, there was something in Brussels.

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,520
 And there have been some approaches to the same idea in the years before.

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,840
 So there were always nerds who knew that windows and

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,560
 pixels are sort of the same concept.

103
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,840
 So, and that was also our approach.

104
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,760
 So we didn't really think of this as being very special in a way.

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,800
 It was more obvious in our view.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,600
 So the innovative part was of course the interactivity.

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,680
 And coupling it with the mobile phone was rather new.

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,200
 And we also wanted to embrace participation.

109
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,800
 So we had this idea of giving out a format description,

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,960
 of giving out tools so that people could do their own movies.

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,840
 And it was really interesting to see that although the resolution,

112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
 that's what we thought.

113
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
 We thought, my god, it's just 144 pixels.

114
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
 Can anybody do something with it?

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,800
 And as you will see when we move over to the other project,

116
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,920
 I think it has actually made things easier for people.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,480
 Because if you reduce the resolution, you also reduce the complexity.

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,160
 And then people had to be super, super creative in order to make something out of

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,440
 it. And I think the BlinkLines movies of this first installation are still the most

120
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,240
 creative that we've ever seen.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,600
 Although you can't see it because the sun is shining on the screen.

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,520
 I apologize for the sun.

123
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,880
 Bad, bad.

124
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,640
 Evil day star.

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
 Anyway, you know, pixels on the screen.

126
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:33,640
 And this was also a simple idea here behind this to have this simple text format.

127
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,280
 I wouldn't choose zeros and ones in the text format if I would redo it.

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,800
 But these are the decisions you make and then you can never change it.

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,000
 So that's that's all you need.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,680
 So you just have this.

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,280
 And with two frames, you just have an animation already.

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:02,560
 So this is what happens if you are inside the building because it was all built with

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,480
 simple relays and everything was very, very simple technology.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,960
 And for anybody who was looking at it, you know, it looks like magic.

135
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,800
 It's like, how have you done this?

136
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,640
 You know, how does this work?

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,800
 People are so amazed about it, which is funny because it's super simple.

138
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,280
 Here's an explanation by our Russian friends who have kind of visualized this

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
 concept, what you have to do.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:51,400
 So you take the building, empty it out, put windows, lights behind the windows.

141
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,760
 And then it's all about timing, you know, you have to make sure that the team is

142
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
 well prepared and knows everybody knows what to do when the time comes.

143
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,520
 You know, people press buttons when people press buttons.

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,080
 You have to go.

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
 There's no other option.

146
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,720
 So it was lots of running around and walking the stairs.

147
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,800
 And we did this for six months.

148
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 Can you imagine?

149
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 It's.

150
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:26,360
 Yeah.

151
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,560
 So game over. Of course, that's not how it worked.

152
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
 How it worked.

153
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 You can see here.

154
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,240
 From dusk till dawn.

155
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
 Oops.

156
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,280
 No, you can't because I pushed the wrong button.

157
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,040
 Oh, my God, Tim, so professional.

158
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,280
 From dusk till dawn, Blinken lights continuously showed a variety of alternating

159
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,920
 animations on its monochrome matrix, eight pixels high by 18 across.

160
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,240
 By offering various options for participation, the CCC invited everyone to

161
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,560
 get involved in this interactive installation.

162
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,160
 The name of the work was derived from the hackers jargon for flashing computer

163
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,440
 consoles, Blinken lights.

164
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:36,480
 By dialing the Blinken lights computer with a mobile phone,

165
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,080
 passersby can play the classic computer game Pong on the giant screen.

166
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,280
 Typically, players are pitted against the computer, but if someone else dials in,

167
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,800
 they get to take over the paddle usually controlled by the computer.

168
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,640
 The game is going on as long as the connection remains established.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,520
 When everybody is hung up, Blinken lights carried on to show its almost endless

170
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,560
 archive of specially designed movies until the next person decides to go for another game of Pong.

171
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:23,360
 The installation used the top eight floors of the house of the teacher.

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,480
 Behind the scenes, the pixels were brought to life by 144 floodlights standing directly

173
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,880
 behind the windows. The windows have been painted white to make them more translucent.

174
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:49,280
 Each light was connected to a simple relay switching the electricity source.

175
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,480
 From each relay, a long control cable spanned the distance to the control center in the eighth

176
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
 floor, totaling more than five kilometers of cable in the whole building.

177
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:08,240
 The control center consisted of three computers interconnected via a local area network.

178
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
 Each system was running self-developed software under the GNU Linux operating system.

179
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 And this is how interaction with Blinken lights works. People either send their Blinken lights

180
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,880
 movies by email or directly call the system with their mobile phone. The chaos control center

181
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,720
 computer manages the animation playlist or reacts to incoming calls, effectively starting the Pong

182
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 game at that very moment. The images to be displayed are constantly transmitted to the

183
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,120
 matrix control computer that is attached to the relays and is responsible for actually

184
00:13:43,120 --> 00:14:00,080
 switching the individual lights on and off. This wild setup of cables actually worked flawlessly

185
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,840
 for 166 days and demonstrated that the hacker's approach to technology is sometimes pretty

186
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:13,840
 unconventional.

187
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 [Music]

188
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:46,480
 Yeah, okay cut. This is just an excerpt of the whole, thanks. It's an excerpt of the of the whole

189
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,800
 full documentation video that's out on YouTube. And well I think it shows that we have accomplished

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,760
 something in that time and we've been very lucky that while we expected the whole system to blow

191
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,560
 up after two weeks because you've seen the cabling, you know, and we didn't really expect lamps and

192
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,320
 especially the relays to work for a significant amount of time. It actually, well, worked half a

193
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,440
 year and we didn't even know that we could use the building for half a year because we were basically

194
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,160
 waiting for renovation to start but this can take time and it took some time and this enabled us to

195
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:36,320
 not only improve the system and respond to user requests and wishes and new ideas that came up.

196
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:45,280
 So we could constantly adapt with the software to new ideas like this wish by many people to

197
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,240
 have their personal movie on screen on demand which we coupled with the Pong game so people could

198
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,240
 call the system Pong starts then they enter their code that we have provided to them and then their

199
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,000
 you know love letter movie starts playing so which was super enabling because you're standing in the

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,480
 city of the capital and you can just like with the press of a button you can just you know make a

201
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,040
 building play your movie to whoever you want to see and that was pretty amazing and it was for us

202
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,160
 also pretty amazing to see the reaction of the city in the beginning only the city and later on

203
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,760
 the rest of the world. I would go more into this aspect let me shed some light on the other projects

204
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,880
 first and I will show you some of the cultural implications this whole project had for us and

205
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,440
 me especially it was a wild ride I can tell you this was like the defining moment in my life and

206
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:49,600
 since then nothing was like before but then we got a call I think it actually was an email I don't

207
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,520
 know so somebody asked me well could you imagine doing this again and this was while the original

208
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:10,080
 Blinkenleid installation was still running and well I said okay where yeah in Paris and I said

209
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,480
 well okay so they had this new art festival that was coming up they had a new mayor and the new

210
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,400
 mayor wanted to do something awesome and he had this idea of doing a new art festival in Paris

211
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:29,920
 which still runs it's called Nuit Blanche I think it started in 2002 and it's still running as far

212
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,120
 as I know and they wanted us kind of as the headliner of this whole festival which was super

213
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,480
 amazing and I thought well yeah we could do it but only if you have an interesting building for us

214
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,560
 yeah and she said well I'm calling you back and she called me back and told me we could you know

215
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,920
 use the facade of the Bibliothèque nationale de France which was quite something and it was super

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,040
 big um here's some impressions if you can spot them so if you don't know the Bibliothèque nationale

217
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:12,960
 de France is a super huge area close to this to La Seine and it's basically four skyscraper buildings

218
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,000
 L-shaped so it's like books you know it's a library so it's supposed to be like four books

219
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,480
 that are standing next to each other there's a park inside but we only got one of the towers

220
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:37,840
 well I would have taken both but in the end I was quite happy that we didn't do that because it

221
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,600
 would have killed us because this had already killed us but we called it a card so as the reference of

222
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,520
 course to the arcade games and but also works as a french word which is also very important that you

223
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,240
 use french words if you're doing something in france to get acceptance and we improved on this

224
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,600
 gaming idea because now we had a larger screen and we would still wanted to retain this interactivity

225
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,000
 and we also wanted to work with gray scaling because before the original blink lights was

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 like pure on off monochrome and nothing else because it was just simple relays and this time

227
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,040
 we improved the technology we use I mean improve the technology we didn't just use simple relays

228
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,280
 we just kind of came up with something we built our own demo boxes and it was still network based

229
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,560
 and this time we had this huge screen and we had new games like pick man and breakout and

230
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,360
 other games

231
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 yeah of course using the higher resolution we could experiment with

232
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,280
 images and and and movies and that's also where the trouble starts I mean

233
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,440
 looking back I would have chosen at least to have less gray scaling you might wonder

234
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 why isn't bigger better is more better I disagree we had like um eight did we have eight I think

235
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,560
 yeah I think we had um eight as three bits um eight gray scales and that was probably the maximum

236
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:27,040
 we should have used um because if you have too much granularity that all becomes kind of mushy

237
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,240
 and anyway but it was still looking great it all depended on how you design it and what I especially

238
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,440
 liked about it is that you could see it basically from from everywhere I mean you could this this

239
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,200
 photo is I think taken at least one kilometer from it away because it stands at the river

240
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,000
 saying and it's had the high visibility from many many places which was gorgeous and then

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,720
 it works much better but it's also important is that we should always think about these

242
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:09,840
 project as architecture projects and not displace although they are displaced but they're still

243
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:23,040
 architecture so we had all these um funny images and let's have a look at how this looked like in

244
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:41,680
 real real animations

245
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,320
 foreign

246
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,960
 foreign

247
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,600
 foreign

248
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
 foreign

249
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
 foreign

250
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,520
 foreign

251
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,160
 foreign

252
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,800
 foreign

253
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
 foreign

254
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:34,720
 these 20 etages with the 26 windows with this wonderful

255
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,920
 steam plan baham that are there for the fact that if the light shiner is shining on the disc

256
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,760
 that you don't see the light shiner but that the whole thing is more or less through

257
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,960
 this opaque area is consistent with this installation is now that we still have eight

258
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,760
 steps that we can represent but 0 to the whole cell eight times

259
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,920
 and the computer only takes its floor out

260
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:19,440
 so next to me and give you the answer to the signal here is the car along the lamp

261
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,840
 in the room here comes the cable goes into the break out boxes then goes into the mc buhain

262
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:37,920
 from there we have a network cable that goes into the cisco and from there a glass driver goes into the basement

263
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,400
 foreign

264
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,880
 foreign

265
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
 foreign

266
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 i have no idea what's happening here with this video and you can't read the english text because it's covered by the sun but basically you get the gist of it this was a complicated installation but in a sense still

267
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,560
 you know using standard technology the twist was that for the first time we developed our own

268
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:40,000
 technology so we had this linux uh customized linux box that we have built to our specifications

269
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,400
 which was doing all the dimming because i mean we could have taken standard dmx lighting equipment i mean

270
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,760
 controlling lamps was not new in 2002 i mean this existed but it would have been super super

271
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,560
 expensive on the one hand and wouldn't have been as flexible as we wanted it to be because there's

272
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,080
 always a tiny twist where you want to optimize something which then you can't do because you

273
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,760
 know closed systems or limitations of the protocol and we wanted to be in control of everything that was the general idea

274
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,800
 so we finished that project in paris and then things calmed down a bit

275
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:31,200
 although we redid the original blinken lights version at the house of the teacher for i forgot like

276
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,840
 two three times to other occasions for a short period of time i'm not sure it was totally worth it but at least we did it

277
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,640
 then the renovation started and there was this construction sign and we actually built a replica

278
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,120
 version as led based inside this construction sign so as long as the building was redone you could

279
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,520
 still look at this and it was always our idea to you know make it permanent in a way i explained

280
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 a bit more about this as well but let's move on to the third part stereoscope which was then done

281
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,080
 in 2008 and again it was a continuation of this new yblange story because the canadians thought

282
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,600
 well what paris is doing is super cool we need to do the same thing so they also started a new yblange

283
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,880
 and of course they wanted blinken lights to be the headliner because that's how it's done you know

284
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,600
 they learned this from paris and at that point in time our team was also you know

285
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,480
 not mostly but partly dismantled people move on doing other things but phil and i we decided okay

286
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,840
 we are going to do this even with a smaller team and so we flew into canada and looked at this

287
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,160
 building not sure you can probably see it but this is the toronto city hall which is an quite amazing

288
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,760
 building it's two sky two curved skyscrapers of different size standing more or less absurd to

289
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,080
 each other open towards the front where there's a big place what's the name of the place again

290
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:15,440
 nathan phillips square so quite iconic very good architecture i liked it and it was basically four

291
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,840
 screens because there are like breaks in the middle and two buildings mean meant okay even

292
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:31,920
 more windows we had 144 in berlin we had 520 in paris and now we were facing 1040 if i remember

293
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:40,400
 this correctly which is a lot you know because if you're doing these projects you really learn

294
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:48,560
 that things can get really messy if you have to multiply everything by 1040 you know if you do

295
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,400
 if you need something to do on one window that takes a minute it means you have another 1040

296
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:02,240
 minutes of work that needs to be spread out over people and so on so we gathered a small team in

297
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,880
 germany and we made a plan and we didn't know you know what would happen but at least we had a plan

298
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,080
 and we were kind of like okay we don't have enough people but we're probably going to make it somehow

299
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:24,560
 um and we would have failed i guess but then at the right moment these guys came in here andrew

300
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:34,240
 and his friends and jonathan and dan would send me an email said i don't when did you hear from

301
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,400
 this project because it wasn't officially i mean announced it was an article all right okay so

302
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,640
 somebody has told somebody something and you read it and you knew and he knew about the original

303
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,680
 project so we came together and as a new international team we uh we made it it was even

304
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,080
 more uh technology so our next focus was actually on the technology because we knew we couldn't do

305
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:10,880
 it with this dimming technology before and so this time we uh built a wireless dimming system so

306
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,480
 there was one of these wireless dimmers attached to the lamps and we still had the same concept of

307
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,240
 putting this um plastic sheets on it which is called dampfbremsfolie in german which is a

308
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,160
 name you should remember um it's usually worked for uh useful for construction you put it in your

309
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,200
 roof to you know prevent steam from entering or leaving the house i don't know anyway but it's

310
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,560
 perfect it's b1 it's fire approved and uh it's super cheap and it's like the perfect diffuser

311
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,400
 for for light it's really amazing we used it here uh as well so it was our focus new technology

312
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,600
 and of course again we were sending udp packets around the building this time it was two buildings

313
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:06,720
 and yeah by magic we made it work like a day before it it worked it was close it was really

314
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,840
 really close this time so some media impressions here as well we did a documentation video but it

315
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:21,600
 was not as good as this report done by daily planet on the discovery channel so let's have

316
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,240
 a look at this i hope the sun is not ruining it completely

317
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:34,320
 for my computer a team of computer hackers commandeers toronto's iconic city hall

318
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,120
 and the authorities don't mind calling themselves project blinkin lights the berlin-based group

319
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,800
 turns the building into a giant video display they unveil it during nuet blanche an all-night

320
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:54,080
 arts festival thousands flock to check it out in fact they get right into it the idea from

321
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,960
 of thinking lights is to turn the building into a display that can be used by anybody in the normal

322
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,160
 mode it just displays various animations there are there's a playlist of movies and just plays back

323
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,440
 one after the other but the really funny part is that you can actually play games on the go

324
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,560
 so you just take your mobile phone call a number and at that moment the display the building shows

325
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:27,200
 a game which you can command and control just using the keypad of your telephone i've got 28

326
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,880
 each of the 960 windows becomes a single pixel in a giant video screen

327
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,440
 they call the display the stereoscope because it takes advantage of the two curved towers unique

328
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,160
 design it's a huge project five months in the planning and more ambitious than the group's

329
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,560
 previous efforts in berlin and paris project Blinkenlights is a group of gifted people

330
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,560
 who are into technology who love technology who love to play around with it and to be a hacker

331
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:05,040
 is not a bad thing the term hacker is something very positive for us hacking is about breaking

332
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:13,120
 things in order to see how it works it's a very creative process so what other people call hackers

333
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,800
 should call should be called criminals all the programming originates from a central command

334
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,200
 station it relays instructions to small computers on each floor they send signals to custom-designed

335
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,680
 wireless dimmers attached to each light directing them to glow at one of 16 different intensities

336
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:40,160
 and every window has to be rigged individually the first thing you have to do is to put up these

337
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:48,400
 cover sheets so now the cover sheets are set up and now we can install the dimmers for the labs

338
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,800
 that's all that needs to be done now the dimmer is fully operational back at the control center

339
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,320
 the team monitors the display via a live video feed and a real-time simulation of what's being

340
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,160
 played in the windows some animations come from Blinkenlights members but anyone can download

341
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:14,400
 the code and send in a show project thinking lights is all about participation when we created our

342
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,040
 first installation we didn't consider it to be an art project we wanted it to be a platform

343
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:28,640
 a platform for people to get in contribute code contribute animation contribute new ideas

344
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:36,080
 and that's exactly what happened we are focusing on enabling technologies in order to make everybody

345
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,240
 participate and even if you don't contribute an animation or play a game you can interact with

346
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:50,960
 the stereoscope we have created this nice 3d simulation simulator that also shows the same

347
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:59,120
 stuff in real time but where you can change the view dynamically and choose from where you want

348
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:10,320
 to actually look at the building so the same program exists for the iphone and that way you

349
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:18,160
 can participate worldwide during new yblash chris palmer can't beat out the other 1200 visitors

350
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,720
 calling in to play video games but he can change his point of view without going anywhere i downloaded

351
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,360
 a little program for my iphone so what's cool is it's giving me a real-time feed of what's up on

352
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,320
 the building right now and you can kind of pan around and see what's on the other side of it

353
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,520
 you know zoom in see it up close change the angle that you're getting at see what it looks like from

354
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,160
 down on the square all of that it's really exciting to see you know what's possible with this kind of

355
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,720
 technology tim pritlov says that the Blinkenlights team are only artists by accident what

356
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,960
 they really do is create giant technologies for people to share with each other project blinking

357
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,800
 lights is also about reclaiming public space bringing such a building especially a city hall

358
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 that's made for the people back to the people in a very literal sense so when you can play a game

359
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,800
 yourself on a building or you can even design your own animation and put it up on this huge screen

360
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,280
 that's something where people really reconnect to the public space kind of pan up see it from

361
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:34,320
 up in the air outer space view that is so cool so cool

362
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:45,920
 yeah dominic and martin they did this iphone app which was one of the first iphone apps in the

363
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:58,720
 app store wasn't it yeah it was one of the first probably the first okay um i think the sun is now

364
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:06,080
 completely ruining my presentation but i tried so what have we learned so far in this project so

365
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:12,800
 first of all it's all about architecture what i really dislike is this trend that has now evolved

366
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,120
 with buildings completely covered in led technology i mean if you've probably seen things like in in

367
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,760
 china where you have like whole areas many many many skyscrapers being one giant building which

368
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:36,240
 is super intrusive and the total opposite of what we try to do also i think you should focus if you

369
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,320
 work with light you should really focus on what the building itself provides in terms of windows

370
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:51,200
 and and other structures so it looks much better it is an architecture project um yeah and i think

371
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:59,120
 we always try to you know be hands-on we wanted to develop our own technology to the extent that it

372
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,480
 makes sense and of course we're not designing our own processors for this but anything you know that

373
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:13,040
 comes along that enables you to have cool features that were otherwise not possible that's always

374
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:22,160
 worth investing time time in i think and with this approach of trying to provide as many angles and

375
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:33,760
 ways to participate and to to integrate with such an installation is always helpful so we had this

376
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,080
 movie formats the editor with the first project and the second project we had this 3d visualization

377
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:49,760
 on the phone which is probably not necessary for this whole thing to work but adds more to it you

378
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:58,000
 know and then you also need to make sense you need to stay simple so that could still be understood

379
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,480
 and it's not too too weird i've always struggled with artists that have projects where you need

380
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,640
 to have like tons of text that you are supposed to read through to understand what it's all about

381
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,520
 and what its meaning is and how to use it actually i think if you do not understand how it works just

382
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:29,680
 by you know standing in front of it you have kind of failed so let's do a small detour on what

383
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:38,400
 hasn't worked and first of all we really struggled to somehow extend this original

384
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,840
 blink and lice project what you can't see now here is our idea of how to make the project

385
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:53,280
 survive on the renovated building so our idea was to leave the windows alone and use the space in

386
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,360
 between and light it up but we were too late for this planning has already started and wasn't clear

387
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:06,720
 if we would get funding for this but i think this would have worked pretty good although it was only

388
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,080
 seven lines and no longer eight lines then but you know at least we tried something else we tried

389
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:24,320
 which didn't work out because of reasons was um okay let me show you what this is you know you see

390
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:33,840
 here a wooden steel structure a mechanic button so this was basically supposed to be a button we

391
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,600
 built this prototype and actually worked but it was probably too complicated would have broken i

392
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:47,440
 don't know wouldn't have survived but the idea was to have a button that you can jump on a button

393
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,400
 that you can jump on and that also has some back pressure with spirals that you could not only jump

394
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,520
 on it but you can like constantly hop on it and being propelled into the air and back like a

395
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,560
 trampoline that was the idea and then of course a switch and this whole thing should be covered

396
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:15,680
 with some kind of acrylic button which is here which you can't see because the sun is completely

397
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:25,440
 ruining my presentation so use your imagination that's what we did we also did a small animation

398
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,480
 which might be visible somehow i don't know to make people understand what we were trying to

399
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,800
 achieve because there wasn't only supposed to be one button of course there should be one button

400
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:45,200
 for each window so here's the building with all the blinking windows but what we wanted to do is

401
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:53,600
 to provide a keyboard to this terminal and then have 144 of these buttons lying on the ground

402
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:00,080
 in front of it and then you should just imagine like a group of kids hopping around on these

403
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,120
 buttons to you know make it work maybe that's an inspiration for other projects we can't do it all

404
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:15,120
 and then there were like tons of dreams we got like buildings from all over the planet you know

405
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:24,080
 it was like everywhere australia south america asia we were very close to doing other projects in

406
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:33,200
 in dublin god i forgot it was so many i constantly people were sending us email here is a nice

407
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,240
 building what do you think and sometimes we even did some 3d rendering so there was a phase for a

408
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,160
 few years where we were like that close to the next installation and then it all erupted into

409
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,440
 nothingness because reasons because always like building owners didn't agree plans for

410
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:00,560
 renovation change money wasn't available or other reasons yeah it was um maybe it was good because

411
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,080
 somehow the story was already uh told but we were always dreamt of having a a third installation so

412
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:14,000
 we were quite happy that we did that with toronto and then you know it was kind of done so i told

413
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,600
 you that there were like lots of cultural uh implications um it's very difficult to explain

414
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:30,160
 but when you do such a project in the middle of a huge city that is you know crazy and and and

415
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:38,160
 people love crazy uh stuff we were really in a maelstrom of attention in a way with this

416
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,200
 installation it took a while especially because we started the project on september 11 2001 so we

417
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,840
 switched it on you know and then new york happened and nobody took notice of our project for for two

418
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:58,560
 weeks but after the dust has settled uh it all went wild and and then we were like busy on a daily

419
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:07,760
 basis for this and Blinkenlights has found its way in in in many uh many parts of of the culture

420
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:16,000
 uh for instance one i have actually forgotten to include in in these slides was that there was a

421
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,160
 remake of the movie uh berlin symphony and i grew start berlin symphony of a capital city

422
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:35,200
 and which was done 100 years ago and there was a remake done in exactly 20 2002 so the original

423
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,960
 movie by valter grossman i think was like daily scenes in berlin standard life so it's like a very

424
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,360
 interesting movie you should watch the original and the remake um where you could just like watch how

425
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:57,360
 people lived in berlin 100 years ago and now there's a remake uh how people lived in berlin in 2002

426
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,600
 so it shows all kinds of scenes uh around the city and big less was also included so that's a nice

427
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:10,720
 touch but it was especially uh welcomed by technology oriented uh culture for instance

428
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,360
 there is a replica of the original Blinkenlights building a miniature wonderland in hamberg

429
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,080
 which is uh if you don't know it it's like a railroad model superlative it's like i don't know

430
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:33,120
 how many kilometers of uh trains they're going and rails they're following it's uh super amazing if

431
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,880
 you haven't been there go there and of course they asked us also if they could include it they have

432
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,120
 no berlin section so it's somehow in in looks like if it's in hamburg but you know they should have a

433
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:53,120
 building section and of course also in this scene there are lots of um replicas there was um at the

434
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:00,320
 second camp i think there was this blinking area a village that kind of took up on the idea and

435
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,360
 produced all kinds of replicas of the original installation other stuff some of them even went

436
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:14,560
 and did similar installation on other buildings so um can't really see it this is like more or less

437
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,720
 a tiny chip just with leds on it which which looks like the uh other one and this is also very

438
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:33,200
 beautiful just believe me yeah um and of course now that we were kind of the official representation

439
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:45,120
 of everything that blinks you know uh a perfect storm of information went towards us you know so

440
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:53,760
 we got notice of everything that was blinking around the planet uh all the time and also some

441
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,080
 things happened just at the same time without us knowing and without them knowing so kind of we

442
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,760
 hit the tone of the time for instance kylie minogue brought out this uh can't get you out of my head

443
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:16,960
 now what did she do of course she was dancing in front of blinking skyscraper that looked like

444
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,840
 exactly like our installation that's of course fake you know i mean the building is not kind

445
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:34,940
 Kylie Minogue. But we honored this with Kylie Minogue dancing on Arcade in the Paris installation

446
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:46,700
 actually. But yeah, can you see more blinking? Yeah, we should have done this probably too.

447
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:58,780
 All those dancers. But it wasn't at the budget. And other artists also took notice. So now

448
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,020
 we were like the hip location to do your new music video. That was the first one was Miss

449
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:18,620
 Kitten which had this what's called Rippin Kitten. So they actually filmed it outside

450
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:28,940
 and on the building. So the girl is now sitting on the building actually. And if you ask yourself

451
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,800
 like oh there's a blinking window is this the original Blinkenlights? There's always

452
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:41,500
 one thing to look for. Because the windows are not completely covered in light. There's

453
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:59,820
 this one line that's dividing each window. Come on, show me one. Feet. Where is it? Okay.

454
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:12,580
 It will come. Anyway, switch to the next one. You can probably see it. And then people just

455
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:20,660
 use it for their own media appearances. Took their own videos. For instance, this is a

456
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:28,980
 video that the Hanf Museum, the Hampton Museum in Berlin took. And of course again they use

457
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,020
 Blinkenlights. And you can see it's real because you see this dividing line. That's

458
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,100
 what I was talking about. And also part of our documentation video which is totally fine.

459
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,220
 They didn't ask but we don't care. Was all out in the open. So they sent in this Hanf

460
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:50,500
 Museum movie as a love letter so they could activate it themselves. Perfect. I like this

461
00:48:50,500 --> 00:49:05,220
 very much. Good music as well. Okay and to top it all off, we got a call of the managers

462
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,180
 of the Toten Hosen and they wanted to do as well. So they actually filmed the music video

463
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:21,380
 inside the building. So they were locating one room very close to the installation and

464
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:32,980
 doing their rock and roll. Should have started later on. Takes a while. Ah, here it's blinking.

465
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:40,340
 So we were in this frenzy of media attention and cultural attention. I could have given

466
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:50,100
 even more examples. It was used in TV advertisements and not everybody asked. Basically nobody.

467
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:56,260
 But we didn't care because we kind of considered Blinkenlights to be in the open anyway and

468
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:03,200
 what can you do. There was enough to do to just make it work. And you know we had the

469
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,060
 appreciation of the people when we announced that we have to take it down at the middle

470
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:22,220
 of 2002. Oh I can tell you people were depressed. But it goes further. I hope you can see it.

471
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:28,180
 It's a bad quality and I have no idea what this is. Actually I have no idea but somehow

472
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:39,020
 it finds its way to me. But somehow Blinkenlights was part of a strange Japanese TV show.

473
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:48,260
 And if you've ever seen Japanese TV shows, they're all strange. So I don't know what's

474
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:54,140
 going on but usually they come up with some weird story and do a quiz show around it or

475
00:50:54,140 --> 00:51:02,860
 some kind of participation. I have no idea. So let's have a look. It's got the real mystery.

476
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:19,300
 So there's some riddle and something is happening. Can you make it louder? So there's a mystery

477
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:34,580
 with buildings. Does anyone speak Japanese? I've never translated it actually. I should

478
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:48,060
 have done this. So now he needs to go to the toilet. Obviously he is in Berlin because now

479
00:51:48,060 --> 00:52:10,700
 there's this white guy. That's how Germans are probably seen.

480
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:31,820
 Something which is probably going on. He's super confused.

481
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:52,740
 I think no Japanese story is complete with some kind of horror or Godzilla like implications.

482
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,880
 I don't know.

483
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,880
 What is going on in this building?

484
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,880
 People gather in front of the building.

485
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,880
 The biggest battle in history begins in this obis building.

486
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,880
 Why?

487
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,880
 This question will be answered by Shinobu Matsumoto.

488
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,880
 Before that, let's show the other people the answer.

489
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,880
 This is what it is.

490
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,880
 The answer is...

491
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,880
 It's a mystery detective story.

492
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,880
 People should come up with answers.

493
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,880
 The first clue.

494
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,880
 A surprising conversation in Otsuka's ears.

495
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
 This is a good place to fight.

496
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
 This is the best place.

497
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,880
 The location is important.

498
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,880
 We're going to fight here?

499
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,880
 Excuse me, do you fight inside the building?

500
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,880
 We fight outside.

501
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:05,880
 The fight takes place outside the building.

502
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,880
 The clue is...

503
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,880
 People who are still here.

504
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,880
 I heard that there are 13 places to fight.

505
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,880
 Where are the other places?

506
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,880
 Of course, all the other places are in the building.

507
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,880
 Just the building?

508
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,880
 Yes, there are no fights outside the building.

509
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,880
 I'm sure the people of Berlin are ready for the fight.

510
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,880
 The fight only takes place in the building.

511
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,880
 The clue is...

512
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,880
 I'm going to give you a hint.

513
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,880
 To solve the mystery.

514
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,880
 This is the most important clue.

515
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,880
 I want to fight now.

516
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
 I want to go to bed now.

517
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
 What? In the afternoon?

518
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,880
 You can't fight in the afternoon.

519
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,880
 The fight takes place at night.

520
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,880
 People gather in front of the building.

521
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,880
 The biggest fight begins in this building.

522
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,880
 Why?

523
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,880
 What is it?

524
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,880
 The clue is...

525
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,880
 The word that Ida said.

526
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,880
 The word that Ida said.

527
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,880
 The word that Ida said.

528
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,880
 Let's solve the mystery.

529
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
 The mystery is...

530
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,880
 The whole video is much longer than I remembered.

531
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
 I would have cut it a bit.

532
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,880
 I think we're getting to the point now.

533
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,880
 Hopefully.

534
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:01,880
 I can't skip it.

535
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,880
 The truth of the mystery is...

536
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,880
 The mystery that happened in the Berlin office building.

537
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,880
 What is the biggest fight in history?

538
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,880
 What is the truth?

539
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:30,880
 What is the biggest fight in history that began in this building?

540
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,880
 The mystery became clear in the dark.

541
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,880
 This is what the fight was like.

542
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,880
 What did Otsuka see?

543
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,880
 It's a giant Tetris.

544
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,880
 How did he do that?

545
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
 Amazing!

546
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,880
 A giant Pac-Man.

547
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
 He's moving.

548
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,880
 A giant Pimps.

549
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,880
 This is real Japanese excitement, of course.

550
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,880
 I'm moving on.

551
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,880
 So they basically took our documentation videos and mixed it all in.

552
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
 It's a weird mix of everything.

553
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
 But...

554
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
 How does it work?

555
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
 Alright.

556
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,880
 So...

557
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,880
 That's the look back.

558
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:52,880
 So some time has passed now and we didn't really do any new projects.

559
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
 Although we have been talking about many, many more.

560
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,880
 But in the end this project is kind of over.

561
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:06,880
 But then I went to the first visiting event here before this camp.

562
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
 And then things happened.

563
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:16,880
 And so we did a new project, which you might have seen here, called Polychrome.

564
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,880
 And it's actually 640 pixels for you.

565
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,880
 10 times 8 by 8.

566
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,880
 And yeah, we called it Polychrome.

567
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,880
 Why did we call it Polychrome?

568
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:36,880
 What you might not know is that Polychrome is a real established term.

569
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
 And it's hidden now behind the sun.

570
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,880
 And it reads, "It's the practice of decorating architectural elements in a variety of colors."

571
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,880
 Perfect match.

572
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,880
 That's what we do.

573
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,880
 So we saw dead pixels.

574
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,880
 So this area, maybe the next shows something.

575
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
 It's crazy.

576
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
 Okay.

577
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,880
 You've seen the windows over there.

578
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,880
 And they were filled with glass bricks just recently.

579
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,880
 Actually three years ago.

580
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,880
 But this has not existed at the last camp.

581
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,880
 So we came up with the idea of doing something about it.

582
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:23,880
 And well, this -- can you see this here?

583
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,880
 This is the windows from behind.

584
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,880
 That's an area where usually the train parks.

585
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,880
 So it just goes through this path.

586
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,880
 There's nothing more to see there.

587
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,880
 And we came up with an idea of how to do lights there.

588
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,880
 And of course, time has passed.

589
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,880
 15 years is a long time.

590
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:53,880
 And when LED technology was totally in a different state of affairs when we started the original blink lights,

591
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,880
 there were only red and green LEDs.

592
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,880
 There were no blue LEDs.

593
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,880
 So at least there were no blue LEDs that you could buy and use.

594
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,880
 They were invented, but they were not ready for sale.

595
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,880
 And of course, there was no cheap LED.

596
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,880
 And there was also no cheap LED that you could do full color with.

597
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,880
 But this time it's possible.

598
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:21,880
 So we looked up our options on Alibaba and found this tiny piece, which is super cool.

599
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,880
 It's actually a round enclosure.

600
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,880
 You might see this here against the sun with three LEDs on one piece.

601
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,880
 And then they are wired with three wires, one after the other, as a bus.

602
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,880
 Technically, it's a TM8040 bus.

603
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,880
 It's a one-wire bus, so you've got power and ground.

604
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,880
 And then you have this data cable where you can address all these LEDs.

605
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,880
 It's nothing new.

606
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,880
 You see this here everywhere.

607
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:59,880
 The only difference between the TM8040 chip and others that are usually in use is that this supports RGBW.

608
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,880
 So it's not only RGB, but it also has a white, pure pixel, warm white, which we expected to use.

609
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,880
 Because the first idea was, let's do monochrome because monochrome is cool and retro and so on.

610
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,880
 In the end, we didn't do this at all.

611
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,880
 So we didn't use the W, but it's still there.

612
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
 And it's powered by 12 volts.

613
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:25,880
 We used the NeoPixel bus library to address this protocol.

614
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,880
 And it's pretty bright.

615
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:35,880
 And like all color LEDs that you can buy on the market, it's not calibrated.

616
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,880
 You will hopefully see this, what it means.

617
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,880
 I have my doubts here if the sun is still disturbing the presentation.

618
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
 Oh, no, it's behind the tree.

619
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
 It's getting better.

620
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,880
 I need to slow down.

621
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,880
 [laughter]

622
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
 Later.

623
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,880
 So you need to control this.

624
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,880
 And in order to control LEDs, you need an LED controller.

625
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,880
 That comes as a surprise to you.

626
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,880
 We bought a ready-made system called QuinnLED, which is super cool.

627
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,880
 It's an ESP32-based processor.

628
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,880
 We have got one of these controllers per window.

629
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,880
 And on top of this processor is a stack with an Ethernet shield

630
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,880
 and also all the power electronics you need in order to run the LEDs.

631
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,880
 So it's separate from the power supply for the processor.

632
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
 So it's pretty nice.

633
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
 It's not too expensive.

634
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
 Works pretty well.

635
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,880
 And on this we have our own firmware that does all the light control

636
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,880
 and also does the color calibration.

637
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,880
 And it also does something that you might not have seen, but it is there.

638
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:56,880
 It's also running an algorithm for afterglowing because we originally wanted to simulate

639
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,880
 the original Blinken lights lamps, which were halogen lamps.

640
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,880
 So they had this natural afterglow if you switched them off.

641
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,880
 And we wanted to simulate that.

642
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,880
 Although we didn't do this in particular, it came in handy because now it's software controlled.

643
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,880
 So whenever you run an app or run a certain animation, you can actually define the afterglow you want to have.

644
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,880
 And the afterglow goes through all the colors perfectly.

645
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,880
 So it's not only brightness actually mixing the colors as you go.

646
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:36,880
 So if you switch from blue to red and you have an afterglow of half a second,

647
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,880
 it's a slow, steady transition through the color space from one color to the other.

648
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,880
 And that makes for the special impression that we have.

649
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:53,880
 Of course, to make the system complete, each of these controllers are connected to the LED chain

650
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,880
 that's stuck behind these windows.

651
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,880
 And they are all interconnected using Ethernet.

652
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,880
 And so there's a central computer that's running all the software.

653
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:11,880
 And we have thrown, well, we didn't really throw away the old software, but we didn't use it.

654
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,880
 It's a completely new software stack.

655
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:25,880
 And it's mostly written in Elixir, which is the best programming language you've heard about at this camp.

656
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,880
 It's really amazing. It does wonder.

657
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,880
 And apart from the firmware and the part that does the audio part of the system,

658
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,880
 of course, we had also one loudspeaker on top of each window.

659
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,880
 Everything is written in Elixir and works beautifully.

660
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:52,880
 So this system, Elixir also comes with the Phoenix Web Library where you can do real-time web development.

661
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,880
 So on the right, you can't see the original simulator.

662
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:06,880
 So we had a web-based simulator for this installation months before we had the system itself ready.

663
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:15,880
 So on the web, you could see in real-time the same stuff, including the afterglow and everything in a real-time web application.

664
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,880
 It's also all written in Elixir.

665
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,880
 So it was really helpful to develop all the software.

666
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,880
 Then, of course, there's this audio output that I mentioned, which we're using the Druze Library

667
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:35,880
 and the controller input, which is the set of buttons on this table in front of the installation.

668
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,880
 The system allows for apps, small, tiny applications that run the games and everything else,

669
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:51,880
 and has idea of playlists and scheduling, all this stuff, and everything else runs on a UDP-based communication.

670
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:57,880
 So basically, all those frames are just thrown onto the Ethernet bus and then it displays.

671
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,880
 If you want to have a look at the code, it's all online at github.com/blinkenleits-polychrome.

672
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,880
 So if you approach this, you really need to find an approach.

673
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:17,880
 And of course, first we visit our old friend, the Dampfbremsfolie, which you have seen in the video, which is so amazing.

674
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:25,880
 It's so cheap, and you really need to use it if you do something with light, because the light distribution is so perfect.

675
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:33,880
 Although this pixel itself makes more or less a perfect circle, you can't see it if you put this crazy on top of it.

676
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,880
 So this was our first pixel.

677
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:43,880
 That was our second pixel, which actually contains one of those glass bricks, and we used that one to calibrate the color,

678
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,880
 and also to calibrate the right distance of the LED towards the glass bricks.

679
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,880
 That's something we need to test. How far away must it be? How close can it be? What's the perfect distance?

680
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,880
 Turns out 15 centimeters was right.

681
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:08,880
 And as we wanted to have these glass bricks, but you had to buy 10, we also did this 3x3 object here,

682
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,880
 which we didn't use, which you can't see because of the evil day star.

683
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:19,880
 Yes. And then we needed this enclosure for all these lamps.

684
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,880
 So that's basically like these ChocoCos cartons.

685
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,880
 It's a matrix of wood plates and with a cover in the back.

686
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,880
 You see Papillon drilling the holes for the LEDs, which you just plug in in the backside,

687
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:46,880
 and then we mounted this whole thing behind the windows, covered with these sheets, and stuck to the wall, which is super easy.

688
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,880
 Now that the sun starts cooperating, you can actually see it.

689
01:07:51,880 --> 01:08:01,880
 This here is the structure that ensures 15 centimeter distance and also shields each pixel from each other

690
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:07,880
 because you don't want to have any light bleeding. And I think we succeeded in that pretty well.

691
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,880
 Here's the top view. So here's the LED in the middle.

692
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:19,880
 Eventually, this is a photo of the prototype where we thought having white walls is a good idea.

693
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:25,880
 Spoiler, it wasn't. It was too bright. Our problem wasn't brightness. Our problem was darkness.

694
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:35,880
 We wanted to have a steady and unnoticeable transition from total darkness to light.

695
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:43,880
 And if it's too bright, even if you put the LEDs on the lowest signal level, like one on each RGB,

696
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:48,880
 it's like switching on the room and all the cockroaches are running away.

697
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:59,880
 It was just too much. So we actually left it brown and added a second layer of this Damfress folia.

698
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:06,880
 And then it was kind of perfect because then if you switch on the light a bit, it's just almost visible

699
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,880
 and you could then really make a smooth transition.

700
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,880
 That's also why on this installation all those transitions look so smooth.

701
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,880
 Otherwise, it would have been really noisy. We tested that.

702
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,880
 So in the end, you put in the LEDs and mount it right in here.

703
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,880
 And we had this pole that just pressed it onto the window and that's it.

704
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,880
 So basically, that's the whole setup.

705
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,880
 So and then we switched it on and we tried color and we said, like, oh my God, this looks so cool.

706
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:43,880
 We need to do color because this glow was just perfect.

707
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:49,880
 Also, the glass bricks add a lot of structure and make it look interesting.

708
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,880
 But that's all the glass bricks do. They do know the fusion of any kind.

709
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,880
 That's all done by the Damfress folia.

710
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:04,880
 So now that the sun has gone, I can hopefully show you what the real astonishing thing is.

711
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,880
 If you take the standard LEDs and you switch them on and then you take your image

712
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:20,880
 with all the original RGB values that look so perfect on your monitor, it looks like this.

713
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,880
 That's like the generic Super Mario.

714
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,880
 And as you can see, there's too much blue. Everything is bleeding out.

715
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,880
 It just looked awful. We didn't know what to do.

716
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,880
 And then we played around a bit with curves and other things and found out,

717
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,880
 well, maybe color calibration is a good way to do it.

718
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,880
 And then Bjorn took the time and actually used this spider,

719
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:53,880
 the thing called the spider color calibration tool that you usually use if you're a professional

720
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,880
 Photoshop artist or something like this to calibrate your monitor and put it on this.

721
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,880
 Hacked a bit so that we could use it here with our installation.

722
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,880
 And now look what color calibration is doing.

723
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,880
 Same information.

724
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,880
 And like magic, it just looks great.

725
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,880
 And it not only looks great, and because there's less blue in it,

726
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,880
 we now could do colors that you're usually impossible to see on any LED installation that's not calibrated.

727
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,880
 So we have brown and dark pink tones and everything.

728
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,880
 So everything is really looking the way you expect it to be.

729
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:39,880
 And that enabled us to do much more vivid imagery here on this installation.

730
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,880
 And then we had this audio system. It's a 10 channel sound system,

731
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:52,880
 which was donated to us or at least we could rent it for free by D&P Audio Techniques.

732
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
 So it's very good loudspeakers.

733
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,880
 And they were just used for action and reaction sounds.

734
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,880
 We used this JOOS audio framework to do that.

735
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
 And we could have done even more with it.

736
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,880
 And we actually had a lot more plans what to do with it.

737
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:14,880
 But music makes light more interesting because then you can correlate much more to what's happening,

738
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
 especially for games, of course, and so on.

739
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,880
 And then we had this controller to control all the things.

740
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,880
 Actually, to be honest, we didn't really have any good idea of how to use it.

741
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,880
 We just knew like 10 buttons was probably a good choice.

742
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,880
 And we also need joysticks. That's all the magic we had.

743
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,880
 So we bought this standard arcade kit and these huge buttons, which are fun to hit on.

744
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
 And yeah, it kind of worked.

745
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,880
 It was, in a way, an experiment while doing all this.

746
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:55,880
 So we used it to control the games, to parametrize other apps.

747
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,880
 Yeah. And then it's usually, you know, you start out with something,

748
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,880
 and then you end up with something completely different.

749
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,880
 And we have now a variety of apps and games.

750
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,880
 So we have this interactive apps, especially the Pixel Fun one, which you have probably seen.

751
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,880
 You can see there, which is super, super, super, super simple idea.

752
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,880
 It's basically just one function that provides numbers from minus one to plus one.

753
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,880
 And then at random, we scale it, assign colors to those values.

754
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,880
 We rotate it, we transform it, we scale it.

755
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,880
 And that's what it makes so interesting.

756
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,880
 And in the latest iteration, we also coupling it with the music.

757
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,880
 So the music is actually triggering this function and does interesting stuff.

758
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:48,880
 So we have the Lemmings you can control. There's a Tetris game. There's a Snake game.

759
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:56,880
 There's a Super Mario. Martin did a Super Mario completely in 8x8, which is amazing.

760
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,880
 And maybe we even have a Wacom All today. I don't know. Could be.

761
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:09,880
 Yes. So what we wanted to do is also sound to light, so that something you can watch this night.

762
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,880
 So music will be running and you can see the impact of the music into the stuff.

763
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:22,880
 And to round it all up, there was also the option to import animations by whoever wants to contribute anything.

764
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,880
 The WebP format is perfect.

765
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:34,880
 And then we have lots of unfinished ideas and missed opportunities because we were running out of time.

766
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,880
 We have been working on this for four months now, I think. True? Yeah, kinda.

767
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:46,880
 So it was really a lot of work. We've been here like the first on this campground. We're probably going to be the last.

768
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:54,880
 But it's like the light installation has been installed here a month ago and probably takes some time to take it down.

769
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:02,880
 Yeah, that's it. So if you walk there tonight, you can see it working.

770
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:17,880
 You see the Pixel Fun real-time app running and you can see the impact of the music it has.

771
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,880
 So a lot more can be done with the installation. Unfortunately, we only have one night left.

772
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:29,880
 But if you like, join us and see what can be done. We were trying to bring up all the games we already had

773
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,880
 and add one or two new ones that haven't run yet throughout the night.

774
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:42,880
 And then it's time to say goodbye. Thanks for listening.

775
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:51,880
 [Applause]

776
01:15:51,880 --> 01:16:02,880
 So any questions? Maybe the team can stand up, including the Canadians. Just say hello so that you know who's done it.

777
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:14,880
 Papillon, Björn, Dominique, Jonathan, Andrew, Dan, Alex, and one more.

778
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:23,880
 Where's Luca? Luca's over there. All right. So any questions?

779
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,880
 Your microphone is not working.

780
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,880
 Okay. Now that question. Okay, I come running with the microphone. Yes?

781
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:39,880
 You said you hacked something with the color collaboration tool. What did you hack?

782
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:46,880
 Yeah, I can answer that. So basically we used the Spider 3, which is like a standard tool

783
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,880
 used in photography to calibrate your monitors. There's open source software for it. We essentially use that.

784
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,880
 They have a web mode where they display the wanted colors on a web page.

785
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,880
 We essentially just scrape that and put that into our controllers.

786
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,880
 And that's what we do essentially to create the curves. So it wasn't just like plain calibrating the single colors,

787
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:15,880
 like toning down the blue. They were really off with the sizes. The curves are pretty hefty, specifically the blue.

788
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,880
 But yes, so that's what we did. We burned it in the firmware and you saw the result.

789
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,880
 Okay, there's more question over here.

790
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,880
 Do you still have the archive of the first project, of the animations?

791
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:36,880
 Yeah, it should all be on github.com/blinkenleids. If it's not, kick me.

792
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:45,880
 I've recently done a deep dive into the old archives. I know it's probably not perfect, not complete, but it's still all there.

793
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:52,880
 The software is there and it's actually running. I could recompile it after 20 years, so it's not all that bad.

794
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,880
 Yes. Next.

795
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:03,880
 I'm wondering about, like, this project apparently scales big with workload, but I'm also thinking about all the money.

796
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,880
 Do you get paid by the artist festivals? Where are you? Ah, there. Okay.

797
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:18,880
 Like, going to different countries and filling big buildings with light installations is not something cheap, I guess.

798
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:30,880
 No. So actually, well, the first one was pure fun and super low cost of everything. I mean, we used just the most basic stuff.

799
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:41,880
 I think in the end, we spent 10,000 DM, so something like 5,000 euros in total.

800
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:49,880
 Some of it was just paid by somebody else, so people came in and said, like, I'm going to buy the lamps and stuff like this.

801
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:59,880
 The remaining stuff, what I didn't tell you is we had this pong telephone line. It was actually running over a value added telephone line, so, you know, 0190.

802
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:15,880
 So actually, we would have made enough money to cover all the costs, but the provider company that was, like, running the line for us went bankrupt during the project, so it was all gone.

803
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:24,880
 But it didn't matter, you know, it was just something. Then Paris was expensive. This was paid by the art festival, of course.

804
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:31,880
 And same in Toronto. More or less covered the costs, so there was not much to earn from it.

805
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:44,880
 Here we got, yeah, there was a coverage by the event for, like, 10% of it, and the rest we just pay ourselves because we're idiots.

806
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,880
 [Applause]

807
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:55,880
 There's another question over here. The question is why polychrome needs to be torn down.

808
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:01,880
 Isn't there any way you could fit this into the whole museum concept in Mildenberg here?

809
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:16,880
 Sure, but this Zigeleipark is only open in summer and closes at 6, and the sun sets at 9. So you could do it, but nobody would see it.

810
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:28,880
 Any more questions? Someone over there? Is this thing on? Use it.

811
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:41,880
 I just wanted to ask about the calibration again, because the controller, the TM-15 something, does it have more than 255 levels, or is it...

812
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,880
 No, it's just 255.

813
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:48,880
 Okay, so you have probably a pretty granular resolution at the low end, basically, yeah.

814
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,880
 Yeah, so that's what we tried to mitigate by making it darker, essentially.

815
01:20:52,880 --> 01:21:00,880
 So when we had the initial setup with the white walls, where we essentially tried to bring as much light as possible to the front, then we had exactly that problem.

816
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:09,880
 Like, the lowest levels were very bright, then we made it artificial darker by making the sides brown, by adding another layer of the famous Damfrensfolium.

817
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:19,880
 And that then actually made the calibration possible, because we had these low-level increases in the light, and then it worked much, much better.

818
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,880
 Alright, over there?

819
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:35,880
 One more question. Tim, from the first project, owner of the building, what feedback did he or she give to you after, you know, an increased interest in the building and word fame?

820
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:47,880
 Well, the owner is from East Berlin and told me that he spent all his money as a young kid to play Pong in the Wuhlheide, at the FEZ.

821
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:56,880
 And when we put up Pong on his new building, he was like in heaven.

822
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,880
 More questions?

823
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,880
 We still have a bit of time?

824
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,880
 There's one over here.

825
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:22,880
 And with the other buildings, was there also some impact from the, you said before, you integrated Blinkenlights basically into the architecture of the building, so changed the people to the building or something like this?

826
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,880
 Yes.

827
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:37,880
 Apart from us getting media architecture prizes, or one, which I don't really care about, but happened.

828
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:44,880
 And I can't really verify this, but this is like what people told me later on in Paris.

829
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:52,880
 Before the Bibliothèque nationale de France, which was the rather new building in Paris, was kind of non-accepted in the city.

830
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,880
 It was like super expensive, you know, when these huge projects started.

831
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:05,880
 I think it was the last project of Francois Mitterrand who really shaped the city with his whole style of big architecture.

832
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:15,880
 And I was told, you know, that with this project and its exposure at Nuit Blanche, people looked at the building differently.

833
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,880
 That's something I can't verify.

834
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,880
 It's just like what was related to me.

835
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,880
 Not sure what happened in Toronto.

836
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,880
 Did that have any long-lasting impact or reactions or anything?

837
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,880
 Can you say something about this? Anybody?

838
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,880
 Come on, because you are from Toronto and I have no idea.

839
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,880
 It made the front page of all the papers, of course, at the time.

840
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:53,880
 And people I talk to still remember it sometimes, like when they ask me, "Why are you going to Berlin for a nerd festival?"

841
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,880
 So...

842
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,880
 Yeah.

843
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:06,880
 Yeah, I think it was already a really favourite site, a favourite building in Toronto.

844
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,880
 Everybody liked it.

845
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,880
 It was a memorable use of the building.

846
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:20,880
 There's more questions. I just need to bring the microphone over there.

847
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,880
 So the first building was empty and unused.

848
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,880
 What about the other buildings in Paris and Toronto?

849
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:32,880
 And if they were in use, how did you deal with people working in the offices and things like that?

850
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,880
 Good question.

851
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:41,880
 The Bibliothèque nationale de France was especially suited to this kind of use because the way the architecture is built,

852
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:51,880
 you have the window, then there was a continuous aisle behind this line of windows.

853
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,880
 So you could just walk along all the windows and there were no offices.

854
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,880
 And then there was a... I think you could turn it, right?

855
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:09,880
 It was fixed in some levels and you could turn it like a huge swinging wooden door that separated the windows from the rest.

856
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,880
 And in the offices you could close and open them if you want the light to come in.

857
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
 You could also close them.

858
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,880
 So usually they are either open or closed.

859
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,880
 And during that project they were all closed and of course everybody was complaining.

860
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:29,880
 Because the mayor of Paris has said this has to happen.

861
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,880
 It happened.

862
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,880
 And nobody complained, at least not to us.

863
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,880
 In Toronto there was more complaining.

864
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,880
 I think we even tried to comfort the people by applying...

865
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:50,880
 Did we come up with an idea of opening and closing them with binder clips?

866
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,880
 So we had to come up with a solution. It was a constant fight.

867
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:00,880
 So all that worked for us was that there was a date when it was going to be dismantled anyway

868
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,880
 so people just calmed down and it was going to end.

869
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,880
 So yeah, it's a problem.

870
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:14,880
 And some of those projects I mentioned, at least one of them was like we didn't find any solution to this.

871
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,880
 Because every office was different.

872
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,880
 Desks very close to the window.

873
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,880
 Everything totally crammed.

874
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,880
 So the building needs to have some kind of...

875
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,880
 Needs to be prepared for us.

876
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,880
 That's what I would say.

877
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,880
 One question over there.

878
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,880
 The Minerva Huvunderland people, are they using your software?

879
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:44,880
 No, we talked about this, but I think we were too slow to react.

880
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,880
 I don't remember.

881
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,880
 But they hack everything themselves. They are the real hackers.

882
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,880
 So they had no problems.

883
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,880
 But they were using our original animations, partly.

884
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,880
 I still hope they are opening a Berlin area and redo this.

885
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,880
 Or a Paris area, then we could do the other bling lights there too.

886
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
 That would be cool.

887
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,880
 Hasn't come up yet.

888
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,880
 So, anything else?

889
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,880
 Yes, I think there's a question over here.

890
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,880
 Yeah, I have the question.

891
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,880
 I can admire all the technical details and the beauty of it.

892
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,880
 But tell me something about the joy of hacker collaboration.

893
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,880
 Because at the end, this is what this is about.

894
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,880
 Right after a million year long pandemic.

895
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,880
 It's all about connectedness again.

896
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:47,880
 Maybe you have an idea of how to share this joy of hacker collaboration that you obviously experience with Polychrome and the other projects.

897
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,880
 Yeah, sure.

898
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:54,880
 We all had, I think, projects lined up after the pandemic.

899
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,880
 Not able to implement something.

900
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,880
 So it was welcoming to many people.

901
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,880
 It was easy.

902
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,880
 With this idea with these windows, it was easy to get everyone together.

903
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,880
 And also with this one, it was specifically interesting because it was so wide.

904
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:15,880
 An area of different things from this woodworking, building, all these things behind the windows.

905
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,880
 To the hardware, like the electronics, all of it.

906
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,880
 Then the audio engine, which is a completely separate thing.

907
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,880
 Then the Alexier live view, all of these things, was very wide.

908
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,880
 And people from all these different areas working together was actually pretty nice.

909
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:34,880
 And in a short time, we actually made something happen that worked very well.

910
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
 All right.

911
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:40,880
 I think we have time for one last question over there, please.

912
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,880
 Yes, I was just wondering when you were developing it, you had to do testing.

913
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:51,880
 Did you worry about the public being confused or calling 911 or something like that?

914
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,880
 This public?

915
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:55,880
 No.

916
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,880
 For the previous project?

917
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,880
 Oh.

918
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:02,880
 Good question.

919
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,880
 There were incidents.

920
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,880
 What was it?

921
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,880
 Wasn't there something in Berlin that...

922
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:22,880
 Well, our major concern was how to deal with the 911, 911 problem.

923
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,880
 So it was not 911, 911 was our problem.

924
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:34,880
 Because it was like, as I said, we switched it on in the night from the 10th to the 11th of September 2001.

925
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,880
 And we're like ready to rumble.

926
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,880
 It's like, yeah, it works.

927
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,880
 Now everybody's going to see it.

928
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
 It's going to be so cool.

929
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,880
 And then everybody's attention was somewhere else.

930
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:53,880
 And everybody was totally...

931
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,880
 How would you describe this feeling that this event had?

932
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:03,880
 I mean, okay, some people thought like, okay, now the explosion is coming to my home city.

933
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:12,880
 But I think it was a situation where everybody experienced some kind of fear and nervousness and anxiety.

934
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,880
 And there we were, like in the middle of the city with a huge building.

935
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:24,880
 And we could have sent everything, any kind of annoying message that brings people to the edge.

936
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,880
 It was totally in our control to make everybody having a bad day.

937
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,880
 And we have also opened this editor to the public.

938
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:39,880
 And of course, it took like a few hours and we had animations with planes flying into skyscrapers and stuff.

939
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,880
 It was all there.

940
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,880
 It was sitting there like, if we do this, they will fry us.

941
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,880
 So we didn't add any of these animations.

942
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:59,880
 And I think for a few days we decided just to only have the blinking heart.

943
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,880
 Like for a couple of nights, just had this blinking heart.

944
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,880
 That's why it's the logo of the project as well.

945
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,880
 And when everybody calmed down, we kind of got more humorous and had like more stuff.

946
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
 And that worked pretty well.

947
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,880
 And lots of people turned to us and said like, oh yeah, everybody was confused.

948
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,880
 I was just at the airport.

949
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:23,880
 Like everybody was out of their mind.

950
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,880
 And then I came to Alexanderplatz and saw the building and life was going on again.

951
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
 So, okay, that was a very personal story.

952
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,880
 It might have been a different experience for somebody else.

953
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,880
 But the emotional attachment to this light installation was really amazing.

954
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:46,880
 I mean, people reacted to it in a very peculiar way, especially Berliners, you know,

955
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,880
 who also always think that Berlin is like the coolest place.

956
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:56,880
 And they somehow adopted this project immediately.

957
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,880
 So when we had to tell people that it's going to be dismantled, they were furious.

958
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,880
 It's like, no, you can't take it away from us.

959
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:12,880
 You know, it's Berlin.

960
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,880
 Who am I to argue with that?

961
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:16,880
 But, you know, we had no choice to do that.

962
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,880
 So in the end, we did a party and it was like the party of Berlin at that day.

963
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:28,880
 It's like all the other clubs had to suffer for a day.

964
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,880
 All right.

965
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:30,880
 All right.

966
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,880
 Thank you very much.

967
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,880
 Let's have it again for Tim and his team, for Blinkelites.

968
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,880
 And the rest of the team.

969
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:42,880
 Thank you.

970
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,880
