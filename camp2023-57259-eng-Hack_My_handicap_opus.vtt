 [MUSIC]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.960
 So hello everyone, welcome to the beautiful Millie Way stage.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.040
 It's so nice to see all of you on this nice and sunny day, which is going to be very hot.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 So what do you have to do?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360
 Drink water!

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.860
 Oh, shit.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.880
 That's true.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.120
 Also use sunscreen and stay in the shade.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.720
 Take care of your fellow creatures.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 So we are live.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.280
 Yes.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.000
 All right.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 So also to my dear creatures on the internet.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'm really pleased to announce Mellie Nooks.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.000
 Mellie Nooks likes to play with machines and is going to talk to us about a very

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.520
 interesting and important topic.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.080
 It's going to be about open source technologies that promote accessibility.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.360
 Please everyone give a warm round of applause to Mellie Nooks.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.000
 Well, good morning CCC.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.160
 Today I'd like to talk to you about how open source technology can help compensate certain

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.880
 handicaps.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.600
 I don't like to talk about myself, so let's just get rid of it first.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 Who am I?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.920
 I'm a 46 year old web dev dropout who turned into an InfoSec consultant.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.960
 Got too many interests to be an expert with anything, but I like to play with machines.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 And I fell in love with hardware hacking during a Mitch Altman's soldering workshop

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.400
 during which I soldered the TV Begone.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.960
 And that was like 10 years ago.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.320
 And I've enjoyed playing with alternative ways to control devices ever since.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.160
 And I'm about to leak some of my most precious medical data and expose my biggest vulnerabilities

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.600
 today so that you, dear best hackers in the universe, can gather enough information and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.240
 motivation to hack the hell out of not just mine, but as many handicaps as you can.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 Well, the context is that we have an environment that's full of connected objects and other

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.240
 gadgets and that makes our life way easier.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.960
 Now we can do about anything from a smart watch to a smartphone.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.120
 You can spy on your kid or turn on the heating or water the plants.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.600
 And these technologies are also very useful to help compensate certain handicaps,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.200
 but they have limits when it regards people whose handicap or combination thereof

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.000
 prevents them from manipulating a smartphone, reading a screen or using vocal command.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.160
 And as a patient, it is very frustrating to be shut off from all these possibilities,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 especially when they have the potential to improve our quality of life and to become

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.120
 more independent.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.880
 Being as autonomous as possible is a need we all share and it shouldn't be a luxury.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.880
 The good news is that it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel because as you all know

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.480
 here I think there are alternative ways to interact with our technological environment

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.520
 and they already exist.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.360
 So define handicap.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.760
 A handicap or disability in proper English is a condition that restricts a person to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.400
 function physically, mentally or socially.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.280
 And they come in all shapes and forms.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.600
 They can be visible, invisible, painful, not painful, temporary, chronical.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:34.320
 And the impact that your handicap has on someone's life mainly depends on available

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.880
 support, resources and surroundings.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.160
 From my own experience, there comes the leak.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.960
 I can safely say that being diagnosed with a serious form of endometriosis turned my

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.480
 life upside down.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.400
 And for those who don't know what endometriosis is, like me, it causes, amongst other unpleasant

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.240
 things, chronic pain and there's no cure yet.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.520
 Yet.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.480
 So I took a few years of hormone therapy and surgeries but now I'm able to sit, walk, stand

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.880
 again.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.400
 But there were long periods of time where every single move and step was painful and

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.040
 dangerous.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.320
 So precious and it had to be anticipated and optimized.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.760
 But I'm okay now.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.520
 Define hack my handicap.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.440
 Well, as a hacker, I made a mistake to consider my body like a complex yet fascinating machine

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.640
 that was full of signals and electrical impulses and where the peripheral nervous system was

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.640
 just another network to debug.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.200
 Senses like the sight of hearing or touch could be replaced by cameras, microphones, sensors

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760
 and a lot of MCUs since machines didn't need them to function.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.840
 And body movement limitation could be expanded by robotic and mechatronic solutions.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.680
 But yeah, in short, I wanted to treat my handicap like a vulgar bug or shortcut that needed

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.160
 fixing.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600
 But I was wrong.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.920
 My perspective changed when I met two other technophiles whose handicaps were different

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.800
 from mine and we're also looking for alternative ways to improve our quality of life.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.520
 So we naturally became friends.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.760
 The target.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:39.440
 Well, our group is small but the combined list of our illnesses, symptoms and things

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.560
 we cannot do is as long as my arm.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.800
 So I guess we are the targets with the notable exception that we are doing it willingly as

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.600
 long as it's in a controlled and safe environment.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.640
 It's not that we don't appreciate our privacy, but let's face it, there's no such things

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.560
 as problem solving without proper problem solving without proper information gathering.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.840
 None of us is smarter than all of us.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.120
 And it's an illusion to think that our medical data are safe anyway.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.720
 So we are represented by this little mascot.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.960
 She's called Nian as you can see.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:32.720
 She can do she represents the combination of our handicap and this is who you should

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.840
 actually be hacking.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.920
 She's representing us.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.920
 So as you can see, she can communicate a bit, but it's painful and she can grab things

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.960
 a little bit.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.600
 So that's the objective to make that makes it very difficult to use a mobile phone, for

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.080
 instance.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.880
 So we need to find an alternative.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.520
 But she reminds us also of the things we can do instead of the things we cannot do.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.920
 And she's a cutie.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.880
 So define the scope.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.960
 Well, living with a handicap in 2023 isn't as effortless as it should be.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.040
 I mean, we have more knowledge, protective laws, medical equipment than ever.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.800
 But many disabilities cannot be compensated yet.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.080
 In my opinion, the main reason for this exclusion is not caused by the lack of available

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.440
 technology called solution, but getting access to them.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.200
 In France, for instance, it's a bureaucratic hell to get equipment.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.480
 Their price is outrageously expensive.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.080
 So it usually takes at least a year between the request for adaptive equipment and its

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.080
 actual delivery to the patient.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.760
 And that's the best case scenario.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:01.840
 Some patients have to wait years for a diagnosis without which with it's not possible to even

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.000
 apply for medical equipment.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.120
 So you can really stay years without support.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.880
 And as long as you don't have the handicap stamp on your card, then you cannot even request

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.680
 any equipment.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:25.200
 And even then, our profile has to fit a strict protocol that doesn't make any sense where

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:34.320
 handicaps are categorized in a sort of spreadsheet and with percentages. And this spreadsheet

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.000
 will determine whether your access to a better quality of life is granted or not.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.960
 The attack surface.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.880
 So I wish we could hack the whole planet to make it accessible for all.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.600
 But it's going to take years to make it happen, if ever.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:02.480
 Reason that this is not happening yet is money, of course.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:10.160
 Straight legislation, proprietary software, medical certification, because every device

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.040
 is not used by somebody with a handicap has to be stamped with a CE.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 It has to be certified to be used.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.720
 And all these things have to be taken into consideration.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.480
 But fortunately, there's a hack to bypass all these constraints.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:41.280
 Since it's not illegal yet to hack our own devices and our own homes, it is possible

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.560
 to build interfaces that will only work for one patient and their environment.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.680
 And another tip is to avoid doing it for commercial purposes if you want to stay out of trouble.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.760
 So it would be, don't do this for money.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.680
 So long live open source technology.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.520
 So I guess the attack surface is located anywhere between what the patient can do

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.640
 and what the patient really would like to do on their own.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.880
 How to?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.960
 Well, most of us know someone who lives with a handicap.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.520
 So that's a good place to start.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.400
 And in many cases, it's just sufficient to show patients or to explore the native

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:36.880
 accessibility functions of their smartphones, like screen readers, vocal command, magnification,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.200
 color correction, or just adding shortcuts to the home screen, and many more.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.960
 And that really, really helps a lot because most people don't know how to fully exploit

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.640
 the possibility of their smartphone.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:12:00.960
 You can also find a lot of information online, but it's not as efficient as joining the,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:10.160
 for instance, the open source medical supply community, or participate to the hacking health

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.720
 marathon.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.280
 So you can just get your hands on it.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:25.520
 And as a tip, also, even if you really want to help, please do not impose your help

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.160
 to someone with a handicap unless they really agree to it.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.120
 And don't call your beta testers guinea pigs.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.240
 It's not very appreciated.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.960
 Resources.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:50.880
 Well, nowadays, it's quite easy to find some affordable hardware that's well documented

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.840
 and open source.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 But my favorite tools to play with are the TV Begone.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.120
 It will always be my favorite because it was the first.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.480
 And it triggered a small revolution in my head because, yeah, soldering it, it taught

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.520
 me so much.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.320
 It gave me countless hours of fun.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:20.400
 And it was also an excellent, and it brought me enough confidence, not a lot, but enough

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.480
 confidence to start playing with hardware.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.480
 And that's, yeah, soldering the TV Begone and playing with the Arduino platform.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:39.120
 And it really opened my world to the open source hardware tools like Arduino, Raspberry Pi.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.680
 And there are many shields and clones.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:52.240
 Another tool I like to play with is the Easy 430 Kronos from Texas Instruments, which is

00:13:52.240 --> 00:14:01.360
 a wearable sports watch development kit that has a microcontroller MSP430 with an integrated

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.520
 subgiga wireless transceiver.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.080
 And it also has a few sensors.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.760
 But basically, it can allow you to program custom wireless application.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.680
 That's back in 2013.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:20.480
 I think it's not sold anymore, but I have one with me if you want to play later.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:30.000
 And I found it particularly useful to use as a mouse replacement because sometimes I

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.320
 needed to get a more comfortable position and the laptop on my legs and the mouse, and

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.680
 it wasn't very handy.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.120
 So that also worked for lazy people, by the way.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:49.680
 So it was just easy to control my computer from, I couldn't do everything with it, but

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.080
 I could at least scroll, select, and go back.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:01.920
 So that was, yeah, that's not open source, but it cost like 50 euros.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.560
 And there's a platform, a development platform with a graphical interface.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:16.000
 So it's a really good way to start playing with this kind of wireless application.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.480
 If you want something that's custom.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.720
 One thing I really like too, if anyone participated in making it, it's the radio badge from the

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.520
 CCC camp from 2015.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:37.360
 That was basically, yeah, that's a full feature SDR, half-duplex transceiver,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.680
 software compatible with HAT ARRIVE.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 And it can process data standalone or pass the samples to the computer where further

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.640
 signal processing can take place with new radio, for example.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.160
 And also the robotic arm edge.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:10.800
 So it's a kit, a robotic arm kit from OUI kit, which is not open source, but that cost

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.320
 also like 50 euros.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.960
 It's quite affordable, very fun to play with.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:24.720
 It comes with a serial remote, but it's possible to, yeah, it's like Arduino shield, let's

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.960
 say, modify the Arduino with a shield motor in one, and then you can do about anything

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.840
 you want with it.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:39.360
 Some people can control it with Bluetooth, for instance.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.600
 But I tried to control it with my sport watch.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.120
 It didn't work so far, but I'm not giving up.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.920
 Work in progress.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.320
 So I've been participating to the Hacking Health Marathon since 2019.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.840
 That's an event that takes place once again in my hometown.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.400
 It's co-organized by the Regional Hospital, the City Hall, and the Polymycotechnique,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:15.520
 which is a kind of federation that gathers 240 local industrial companies, and sharing

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.520
 on the kits is perfectly legal.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:24.640
 About 20 challenges are selected every year, and each challenge represents a problem, a

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.360
 problematic suggested by a patient or medical care provider for which no solution has been

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:31.920
 found yet.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.880
 After that, we get 48 hours to provide a POC or a prototype with the support of many experts

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.680
 and well equipped FabLab in a fantastic environment and amazing people.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.880
 And so far, from the previous participation, I'm glad I had the opportunity to work on

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:59.760
 developing a communication model dedicated to people with Loctin syndrome.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.960
 Some kind of alternative universal control for someone who couldn't move a lot or two,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.000
 and an assistive robotic arm that help people eat on their own.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.400
 The impossible interface.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:23.920
 I was participating to the Hacking Health for three years, and last year I took all

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:30.400
 my courage, but I suggested a challenge instead of just participating.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:37.280
 And the challenge I offered was to find a solution for people with low arm and finger

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.920
 mobility, who couldn't use smartphone in the traditional ways, and that could allow an

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.720
 easier interaction with their connected object as well with non-connected object, such as

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.800
 the button of a lift or just a light switch.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.360
 And this is why it was nicknamed impossible, because you either can't control something

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:09.760
 that's connected or you have an arm to press a switch, but there's no app that can press

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.120
 a lift button.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:17.840
 Our time was limited, so we focused on Hacking the Lift and built a prototype that's basically

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:24.000
 a servo motor on rails with an Arduino Uno controlled by the Arduino.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 And we made a nice fake finger, so that it really was like a physical finger that could

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:43.920
 be controlled with the Arduino, it was through Arduino infrared remote, because we didn't

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.520
 have Bluetooth options at the time.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.160
 Infrared is not really good for people with low mobility, by the way, because you have

00:19:52.160 --> 00:20:01.280
 to be right in front of the receiver to be able to control it.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.120
 19 minutes.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:12.800
 So playing with the lift was very instructive, but the solution had too many limits, and

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.760
 only adapted lifts could have been used anyway.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.880
 So I went back to the original idea of building a universal remote control that could handle

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:31.360
 several communication protocols like a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, infrared, LoRa, and that could also

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.160
 control a robotic arm when a physical interaction was needed.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.400
 So I'm still convinced it is possible to build it, so I changed the name from the Impossible

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.800
 interface to Bucu, which fundamentally sounds like little cute in French.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.040
 However, there's still a long road ahead, and it's going to take a lot of time to get

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.280
 there.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:59.440
 And that's why I like to take this opportunity to ask for your precious help to make Bucu

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.000
 safer, stronger, and smarter.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:11.120
 So don't hesitate to contact me by mail if you have any question at project@albayus.tech.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:18.200
 And yeah, the help I need is not just sending money, because with the money I'm only going

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:28.320
 to buy some hardware, and what we really need is technical expertise, because once again

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.280
 none of us is smarter than all of us.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:40.640
 And for last, this is a picture of what Bucu looks like for now.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:48.120
 It's a five axis robot that's Arduino compatible.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.640
 There are actually six servo motors, and the extra one I put it on the top with this fake

00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:09.040
 finger to show that we could manipulate it like an extra finger if the hook wasn't enough.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.800
 And on the right hand side you have one of my beta tester, and it's not on scale, it's

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.520
 just a prototype, but the idea would be to be able to clip it on a wheelchair tablet,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:31.120
 and then use this, we did the test with the badge from MCH from last year, and use it

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.480
 as a Bluetooth remote control.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.880
 And there's Neoncast on it, so it's good.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.560
 Okay, so that's it for today.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:51.440
 Any questions?

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.200
 Thank you so much, Merlinux, for your insights and sharing all your experiences.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.320
 We have five minutes for questions.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.140
 Over there is an angel.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:09.360
 If you wish to ask a question, please go over to the angel and speak into the microphone.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.800
 But maybe you could go a bit more into detail what kind of technical knowledge you need

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.120
 right now.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.080
 Maybe can you say something to that?

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:34.640
 Technique, mechatronics, signal treatment, any web developers, I think it would be nice

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.720
 to build a website, I didn't do it yet, but it's in the pipe, so if someone could take

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.280
 this out of my hand, that would be lovely.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.200
 But yeah, I always say if you want to help, I'd rather have a donation in time, but if

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.880
 you have nothing else, you can offer money, but I'm only going to buy hardware with it,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:00.320
 so I'd rather have hardware and technical expertise.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:08.440
 Hello, thanks for sharing your experience and insights.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:18.640
 My question would be if I someday, or some of us might come into a company that is building

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:26.560
 some kind of technologies like personal lifts or whatever, and we want to suggest optimisations,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.120
 but do not have ourselves the experience of having some kind of disability, is there some

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:39.800
 kind of document of known issues I could just hand over and say, hey, maybe these are the

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.520
 problems, let's go into it, because the usual problem as we all know is that often in these

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:53.040
 rooms where the decisions are made, we have a lot of male-wide people sitting, no handicaps,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.400
 and no-one is just aware of, hey, it could be easy if we just implement it, but we are

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.640
 not aware of it, is there some just a...

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.480
 There's no centralised platform where you can, you know, like a weak page, not yet, that's

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.080
 why I need a web there.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.560
 The plan is of course this is open source and the goal is to make it under 500 euros,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.720
 but that would be indeed ideal if we had just one platform where we could gather all the

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:27.760
 information, work in progress, where do I need help, and there is the website of open

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:37.560
 sourcemedicalsupplies.org that is very good and it was born during the first wave of Covid,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:43.840
 and so yeah, there's a whole community out there, we're not alone anymore, and so you

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:51.360
 can already find a lot of solutions, alternative solutions, let's say, whether it's about making

00:25:51.360 --> 00:26:01.280
 water drinkable or making a face mask and some assistive, open source assistive robots.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.200
 I'm not the first one to try this, there's lots of co-documentation online, but I'm not

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.840
 sure I answered your question.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.520
 I mean you can still drop an email if you're interested, don't hesitate.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520
 To the email?

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.320
 The email to the homepage on one of your first slides, hack my health or something?

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:37.560
 Hack my handicap, I put my email right there as the here, take a picture if you want.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560
 Christian?

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:47.040
 Yeah, thank you for the talk, and you mentioned donations and hardware, is there anything

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.680
 specifically that you'd like and can people send it to you and is, you know, what sort

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680
 of?

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:04.800
 Anything, really, we can, I mean all the micro USB devices that are obsolete now, we can

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.880
 still use them, you know, all the legacy tech, let's say, so if you have, I don't know, old

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:26.320
 Raspberry Pi, servo motors, microcontrollers, yeah, the hardware is hard to get my hands

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 on, it's affordable now, but I break so much stuff that it costs me a lot of money.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.920
 But yeah, but the expertise is really the most precious for me, because this is like

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:48.960
 my hobby, this is not my profession, and I'm not that smart on my own, so yeah, any help

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:56.200
 really is welcome, but definitely hardware, if you have anything, you know, lots of people

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.280
 get the badge, don't use it, so if you don't know what to do with your badge, you can recycle

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.040
 it with me, I will take great care of it.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040
 Thanks.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040
 All right.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040
 All right.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.560
 Thank you all for your questions.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.040
 This was the talk of Mellanox, hack my handicap, please give a warm round of applause for our

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040
 awesome speaker.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.040
 [Applause]

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:30.040
