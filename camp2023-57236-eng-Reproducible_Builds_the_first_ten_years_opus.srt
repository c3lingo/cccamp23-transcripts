 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hello, welcome to the Bits and Boimers stage for the next talk. Please try to find a place in the shadows.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Have your water ready and so on. Yeah, I should remind you if you're leaving camp and you still have stuff you don't want to take back and it's too nice to trash,

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 you can go to InfoDesk and try to donate it there and they will try to do something useful with it.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 As I guess the rumors have already spread that there's a little bit of COVID going around, it's not more than what would have been to expected as such a huge crowd.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 If you have questions regarding that, you can go for testing at CERT and there are masks and whatever stuff available at CERT, Heaven and InfoDesk.

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Welcome to the Bits and Boimers stage for the next talk and for that I welcome Holger on stage and he will talk about reproducible builds the first 10 years.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Give him a warm welcome and enjoy the talk.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Hello, thank you. I'm Holger, I live in Germany, I work a lot on Debian and since a long time I also work on reproducible builds since 10 years.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Even though I really love Debian, I try to make all software reproducible and this is a pretty complex topic so just talk to me anytime, I'm happy to talk about it.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I will miss lots of things in this talk.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So, reproducible builds. This is not my talk, this is a list of people working on this, it's from the webpage, it's about 100 people but I think the list is at least double as long.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So, who of you has heard about reproducible builds and why it's useful?

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Nice.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Who has contributed or is contributing?

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Ah, some people, nice.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Who knows, reproducible builds have been around for more than 10 years.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Few. For more than 30 years.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 This is really an old idea actually.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Who has heard about S-bomb files?

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Hey, hey, S-bomb is some fancy new thing that the US government wants.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Software build of materials and we have them since 9 years as build info files. They are basically the same, just the format is a bit different.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And, yeah, we need you, we need people in all upstream projects and elsewhere to make sure that their software builds are reproducible.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So, we need your help.

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 It's hot.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 The goal of the talk is to get you involved.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Because we have done a lot but it's still a lot to do.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So, introduction.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 The problem is that source code of free software is freely available but nobody uses source code, we all use binaries.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And there's no one really knows how they really correspond, even those building the binaries.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Because you need trust the computer and the build chain and what not.

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So, there's various supply chain attacks.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And in 2007 somebody suggested on Debian Devil to make create reproducible binaries and that there was a huge threat with 50 mails and people said this is not possible.

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And the same even happened earlier in the year 2000, same idea was shot down quite quickly.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And then in 2017 John Gilmore from Cycmas wrote that GCC was reproducible in the early 90s on several architectures.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And not only GCC but also the whole tool chain there.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And that bit rotted away.

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And now five years ago the GCC people weren't even aware anymore that it was reproducible in the 90s.

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And now fast forward to this year, in April there was a mail on the WireGuard mailing list that their VPN client is now reproducible on their webpage.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 The build is identical in Google Play Store and F-Droid.

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And that's pretty wow and we were not even informed.

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They just did it.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And it's pretty, pretty cool.

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I'm really happy.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So our mission is to enable anyone to independently verify that a given source produces bit by bit identical results.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So we are an important building block in the supply chain to make supply chains more secure, nothing more and nothing less.

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Insecure software is still insecure software.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Just distributed securely.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So that has nothing to do with making the software more secure in itself.

51
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And by now this has been widely understood.

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 We have documented this on the webpage.

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The resources are like 50 talks we've been given on various conferences in the last 10 years.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Doc, we have common pitfalls and problems and solutions.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 There's about 10 or 15 scientific publications by now.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And there was this White House government statement in 2001 which requires these SBOM files for governmental software.

57
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And on page 42 they also required recommended reproducible builds.

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And reproducible builds really are verified SBOMs.

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Because SBOM is just a statement from the manufacturer.

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 This should be in there and everybody can lie about this.

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And reproducible builds gives you verified SBOMs.

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So we've made a definition to really define when is a build reproducible.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And a build is reproducible if given the same source code, build environment and build instructions.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Any party can recreate bit by bit identical copies of all specified artifacts.

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And what's intended this to define what build environment means, what the source code means,

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and this is there on this page so that we are all on the same page when discussing this.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And how did we get there?

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 With money was the reason and at what's known.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Why money? Bitcoin.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Bitcoin, I don't know when it, since Bitcoin is probably 2009 or something and 2011,

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 it's older, but in 2011 when Bitcoin has a market cap of $4 billion US,

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 they wanted to be secure that if there's a malice backdoored Bitcoin client

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 which stole, steals all your money, that they could not be blamed

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 because the sources are available and it's not backdoored.

75
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So they made Bitcoin reproducible in 2011,

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 which then was an inspiration for the Tor browser people.

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And Mike Perry made Tor browser available in 2013, directly after this known revelations.

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And that was, is Firefox Tor browser and that's one of the biggest software projects in the world.

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's like 70 megabytes the binary and it was possible to make this bit by bit identical.

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And of course it was not only this, but many, many people did a lot of work on this.

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So Luna, fellow Debian developer, made a workshop at Debcom 13 in 2013

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 and gathered 30 Debian people and discussed whether it's possible.

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And then there was another buff at Debcom 14.

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 There are patches for D-package to sort the files inside in a deterministic order

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 and create a build info file so that instructions, what is needed,

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 what's the build environment, what are the build instructions to build a package.

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And in September 2014, I started systematic builds of Debian packages, built with them twice.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 At first I just did 100 packages in a while loop,

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 and then I just wrote a bit of code and tested all of them.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And then Mike Perry and Seth Schoen gave the presentation at CCC Congress in 2014,

91
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 showing my graphs and I was sitting in the audience, did not expect that, it was really nice.

92
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And I'll show you some slides of this talk because it's a really nice summary why it's useful.

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So most people think, or there's a false issue that users should have the source code

94
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and build the software themselves,

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 but they only prove that the binary comes from the source as somebody said so.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And that is probably not enough.

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And most people think also, I know what's in the binary because I compiled it myself,

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 and I'm upstanding, careful, responsible, I always watch my laptop,

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 why should I have to worry about hypothetical risks in the contents of my binaries?

100
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I'm not that interesting, but developers write code which is used by many people,

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 sometimes millions of people and billions, and they're interesting people.

102
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So there's been theoretical and practical attacks against infrastructure used by Linux,

103
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 BSD anything, there's also been the Snowden papers,

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 the designs from the CIA how to attack this, and this has been found in the wild.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And they also showed nice compromises,

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 it's hard to attack, extremely possible, extremely harmful.

107
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Imagine the most secure computer in the world.

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Is this computer still secure if it's networked, accessible by others?

109
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 You put USB devices in there, it runs strange Java code,

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 several nation states want to access it.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 What if access to this computer gives you access to hundreds of millions of other computers,

112
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 bank accounts, every Windows computer in the world,

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and what money you can gain from it.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 So they showed a small back door in OpenSSH, remote exploit,

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 where the diff is greater, equal, it was greater and it had to be greater equal,

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and the diff in the binary is one bit.

117
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So if you look at this 500 kilobyte, one bit decides whether this is secure or not secure.

118
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And that's really hard to find.

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And that's also why we say everything has to be bit by bit identical,

120
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 nor there should not be stuff which we can ignore,

121
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 because it's easier to say everything is the same.

122
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 They also built a nice kernel module, which modifies the source code

123
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 when the compiler builds it, but not when you look at it with an editor.

124
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 So the source code is fine unless you compile it.

125
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And that was the graph they showed.

126
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 The green packages are reproducible packages, the yellow ones, orange ones are unreproducible,

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 and that is from end of 2014 to the end of 2015.

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And you can see there we reach probably 70% reproducibility in Debian back then already.

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 [Applause]

130
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 So in 2015, Luna and myself gave a talk at FOSDEM,

131
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 inviting the free software world at large to collaborate and tackle this problem.

132
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And here at CCCCAM, Luna gave a presentation showing many problems and their solutions,

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 like what to do with G-SIM, what to do with TAR, whatever this,

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 obviously options needed.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And we had a summit in Athens where 15 projects, I think, were there to collaborate.

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And in 2014, we wrote the source data epoch specification, which I'll explain in a second.

137
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And we started writing DifoScope.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So at first, the reasons for unreproduciabilities we found are timestamps,

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 timestamps, timestamps, and more, and build passes.

140
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And the problem with build passes is really easily solved by just rebuilding the same build pass

141
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 and not randomizing the build pass on every build.

142
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And then there's the rest.

143
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And that's 422 issues we found, types of issues, and we have documented them.

144
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Luna gave this talk to explain them.

145
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And we made an unreproducible package which shows the problems you can have,

146
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 because it's way easier to show how not to do it than to show how to do it.

147
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And so in the last 10 years, we've submitted 2,500 reproducibility-related bugs.

148
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 500 bugs are still open, but we also did submit 20,000 bugs about mostly packages building some source.

149
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So we found other problems while continuously testing the VM in this case.

150
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And there's more unexpected benefits of reproducibility.

151
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 If the software builds reproducibility, then the compiler can cache a lot of more things,

152
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 so it's way faster, especially if you build big projects.

153
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So it saves time for the developers and does money for the companies.

154
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And for software development, it's also good to see if the change only really has the desired effect on this object and not other parts.

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And license compliance, you can only be sure you're running free software if the binary comes from the source.

156
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And the only way to find it out is to rebuild and have an identical result.

157
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And yeah, you get reproducible verified S-bombs also.

158
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So DifoScope. Who knows about DifoScope here?

159
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 A few, way too little.

160
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Who uses DifoScope? Same people, more or less.

161
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So DifoScope tries to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories different.

162
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various binary formats into more human readable forms to compare them.

163
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So it has text and HTML output and can support many file formats.

164
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 So it's whatever, Berkeley database, Debian packages, Elf binaries, Haskell files, ISO images, JPEG images, PGP signatures, whatever.

165
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And if it doesn't know the file type, it goes back to Hexdom comparison.

166
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It has fuzzy matching to Henry namings and much more.

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And I show you a bit DifoScope.

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So this is HTTPS Everywhere Firefox extension with two different versions.

169
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And you see on the left side the 506 version, on the right the 507.

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Or maybe you don't see it because the light is shitty.

171
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And it will show there directly the diff in the file to what's in there.

172
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So it takes a tar archive and goes in there, blah, blah, blah.

173
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You have to be faster, you know.

174
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And so that also shows you nicely the diffs.

175
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So also try DifoScope where you can upload two files and DifoScope will then run for you.

176
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It's the web page and you can install it everywhere.

177
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 SourceState Epoch.

178
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I'll skip this because time stamps are meaningless because they vary at each bit.

179
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 So SourceState Epoch is the time of the last modification of the source code because that is useful.

180
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And it's supported by a lot of software today, like 100 software, all the compilers,

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 and many documentation frameworks.

182
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And we have a specification which is like one or two kilobytes in size and is very stable.

183
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 So we have many summits.

184
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 We have another summit this year in Hamburg.

185
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And there were like 40 projects by now, which is really cool to collaborate.

186
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Which brings me to funding.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 We are a software freedom conservancy project now since 2018.

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Four people are funded by this.

189
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 We need funding for the summit this year in Hamburg and we need funding for our general work.

190
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Thank you for funding.

191
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I skipped most of the things now.

192
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 This is the result for Debian unstable for the last 10 years, so it's pretty stable.

193
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Trixie is pretty boring because Trixie is just two months old.

194
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And this is the numbers for Debian.

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 So we -- it's harder to read.

196
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 The interesting part of the unreproducible packages, which are still way too many,

197
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 1,100, but it's only 3.3% of the software archive.

198
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The rest is reproducible.

199
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so each release, Debian release, we get 3,000 more packages.

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But they are mostly the same number of unreproducible packages.

201
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 We managed to change Debian policy in 2017 saying packages should be reproducible.

202
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I now want packages must not regret.

203
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And then new packages also must be reproducible.

204
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And then in '27 or whatever, all packages must be reproducible.

205
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And I would also like to see this faster, to have it two years earlier,

206
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that this year we already don't allow new packages which are unreproducible.

207
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And this 100% is a political decision.

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's not technical.

209
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 So we need to change Debian policy and say whatever the last 2%, we just kick out.

210
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Debian needs to change the policy, not we.

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And 100% reproducibility in theory is not enough because we need to rebuild us.

212
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And for Debian we need a working snapshot service, transparency logs also that we know

213
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 which binaries we have installed, also for the non-reproducible packages this is useful.

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And we also need binary transparency logs.

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And this is true for all projects, not Debian.

216
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I skipped the other projects a bit now.

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 They are all in theory, it's nice.

218
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Even Fedora has now enabled finally in macro to enable source.epoch when building up EM packages.

219
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So today many projects support reproducibility, but it's unclear what it means,

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 how it's enforced and how users can know and be confident because it's just in theory.

221
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We can do it, but we don't really do it.

222
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 I call that reproducibility in theory on CI, and that is a massive success.

223
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 This was thought impossible 10 years ago.

224
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And this is again from this 2014, which is all the other part.

225
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Infrastructure should be created independently.

226
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 This has not been done yet nowhere really.

227
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So in theory we are done, in practice we are just done in theory.

228
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So we need rebuilders, we need to store the results somewhere,

229
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 and we need to define criteria how tools should treat that data,

230
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and then we need those tools also.

231
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And those missing 5% are also still crucial.

232
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 At least 300 softwares need to be fixed to have the software which we all run.

233
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So in summary, many projects support reproducibility in theory,

234
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 but it's unclear what it means in practice and how users can know and be confident.

235
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And this is huge success.

236
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Now we need to finish this last bit.

237
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 We need to create infrastructure for rebuilders.

238
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 We need to create infrastructure to processes and tools to securely use those results.

239
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And we need project level consensus and commitment to reproducibility in practice.

240
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Thank you.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Thank you Holger.

242
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I think we have about time for one very urgent question, maybe two.

243
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Thank you, great talk.

244
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So you mentioned at the beginning some caveats and like known issues.

245
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So is one of those the fact that when everybody runs the same binary,

246
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 one exploit is enough to own everybody?

247
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Well, that is a side effect of course.

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But the result is not everybody runs scrambled software.

249
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Layers of protection or whatever you want to add there, but it's not.

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I guess we can take that.

251
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So you mentioned rebuilders, which are like a really interesting concept.

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Are there existing projects which make it easy to, for example, set up a rebuilder

253
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 which automatically rebuilds like maybe all Debian packages and some others

254
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and then exposes them in a standardized format.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So for example, clients can have a list of rebuilders they trust

256
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 and then check with all of them if the package is correct before installing it.

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 We have at least two rebuilder implementation which are both used by different people.

258
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 For Arch Linux it's really nice working.

259
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 For Debian we need the snapshot service which is not working.

260
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 So rebuilders for Debian don't work at the moment.

261
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 So with that I guess we have reached the end of our time.

262
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And so I want to thank Holger again for giving this nice talk

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and then enjoy the rest of camp.

264
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,580
 (gentle music)

265
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,000
 (soft music)
