# cccamp23 transcripts

Transcripts of all recordings from cccamp 2023, based on media.ccc.de audio.

The transcripts were automatically generated with partial manual editing.
You are invited to contribute fixes by submitting pull requests.

Transcripts are provided in the following formats:

- .srt (SubRip)
- .vtt (WebVTT)
- .txt (plain text)

If you edit text, ideally try to change all three files. If that's not
possible, please focus on the .txt file first.
