 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,480
 >> Do actual exit routes.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,560
 Now I'm on. Hello everybody.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,080
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,280
 So in order to not waste too much time in my yabbering,

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
 but instead listen to somebody smart,

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,600
 welcome to the next talk.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,240
 I'm not sure if you're actually here by your own choice,

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,960
 or if somebody has had a spell on you,

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
 but maybe you'll find out after 20 minutes,

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,400
 after the talk by Uwe Hecker about identifying social engineering.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
 Thank you.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,520
 [APPLAUSE]

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,720
 Thank you very much.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,960
 Yeah, welcome.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,320
 20 minutes and I want to show you a bit what I did,

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,440
 well, almost the last 10 years to identify social engineering,

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,080
 because it's quite a challenge.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
 Okay, let's start.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
 Why I am doing that?

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,600
 So the first thing is after years in information security,

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,560
 I always had the feeling that

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,520
 digital and physical security measures are not really

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,880
 capable of dealing with the human element.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,880
 So you do everything, firewalls, antivirus and so on,

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,360
 physical access control, and then at the end,

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,520
 someone can social engineer or just get into the building

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,120
 or bypass anything with a malicious USB stick, etc.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,480
 So there's always this kind of human element,

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,360
 and we had a very famous paper in 1999,

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,760
 which is "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt",

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,040
 and it's about PGP 4.0, so a long time ago,

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:25,160
 but still we have the challenge how to get security measures used,

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,720
 and do we want that end users use security measures directly?

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,240
 So it was PGP 5.0.

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,760
 We are still having that issue.

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
 If an end user who is not security savvy

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,160
 needs to interact with security mechanisms,

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,200
 something like memorizing a password,

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
 recalling a password, entering a password,

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
 and then we tell them, "Okay, please use a complex long password,"

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,240
 and then we say, "Okay, use multi-factor authentication,"

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
 and the user says, "Okay, so much security, are you paranoid?"

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,640
 So that's maybe the end user perspective,

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
 "Why are you doing all that stuff?"

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,160
 And the security engineer says, "Why?

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
 It's just that easy, just do it."

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,400
 But from a workflow perspective, you always get interrupted.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
 There's a pop-up, "Ah, VPN down."

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,280
 So I need then multi-factor authentication again,

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,560
 and your workflow gets interrupted, which costs time.

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,120
 So there is this approach, "Okay, then use opportunistic encryption,

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,440
 and let's see later maybe if it was secure."

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,720
 Maybe the key changed,

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,240
 and then you will see something, the safety number change.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,960
 And for an end user, what does that tell an end user?

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,480
 They just say, "Okay, safety number changed, and now?"

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,000
 "Don't know, let's go on."

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
 So we still have to tackle this issue.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
 It's called, the research topic is usable security.

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,840
 On the other hand, if you force an end user

63
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,720
 to use security-related mechanisms,

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,200
 then they become a part of the attack vector, of the attack surface.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,520
 They can be attacked as well.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,880
 You have digital, physical security measures,

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,160
 and then you force them, and then you can attack them as well.

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,000
 You can exploit that factor,

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,560
 which makes it quite difficult to deal with,

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,480
 to protect our assets, whatever that is, against such attacks.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,760
 If you use the complex password, long password, an MFA,

72
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,200
 then social engineering is quite easy to circumvent that,

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,440
 to just make all these kind of cool ideas,

74
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,240
 cool, we will see in use of security maybe a few years later, obsolete.

75
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,640
 So obsolete in the sense of, no, this factor can be exploited.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,120
 So what my question was at the beginning, over 10 years ago,

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
 is we always have to deal with this factor,

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
 and how can we go further there?

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
 How can we understand that? Why are maybe some end users more susceptible to,

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,480
 for example, social engineering than others?

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,760
 So I was looking for a suitable social engineering definition,

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,120
 which means suitable for interdisciplinary research,

83
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:40,360
 for finding then social engineering stories, anecdotes in the wild.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 How to get such insights?

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,520
 How does social engineering work, the modus operandi?

86
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,920
 So we need somehow evidence.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,640
 What kind of evidence ever?

88
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,880
 Or you can use experimental designs.

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,200
 But the point is, what is social engineering?

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,320
 How can I identify it?

91
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,200
 So my first approach was looking for indicators

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,880
 in a cycle of interlocking deduction and induction,

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,480
 so it was over the years, and looking for a definition.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,280
 And of course, you know the famous XKCD.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
 I have a new one.

96
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,520
 But the point for me was that it's not single use.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:31,360
 These indicators can be used as well for identifying social engineering in the wild.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,840
 So it's dual use.

99
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,720
 In the end, it's for me for identifying social engineering.

100
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 So when I was looking for a definition,

101
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,560
 I came up, ah, there's an RFC, perfect, RFC 4949.

102
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,600
 Yeah, they say don't use that.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
 It's too widely used.

104
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,920
 And the majority of papers or talks, et cetera, say social engineering.

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,720
 You know, everyone knows something, and everyone has a different view.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,520
 Me as well, no?

107
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,800
 So I'm standing here.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,920
 And please don't use that.

109
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,240
 And using just examples to define it is not the best approach.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,560
 I was looking for a good definition and then find the indicators.

111
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
 The challenge, so, was as well to do this interdisciplinary research

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,800
 because social engineering is not just computer science.

113
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,200
 And suitable, of course, I already mentioned that.

114
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,200
 But also, it should not be too general.

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,880
 Some people say every human interaction is social engineering.

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,200
 A kid at the checkout in the supermarket sees some sweets.

117
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,400
 OK, social engineers may be the parents, but is this social engineering?

118
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,120
 So this was all the cycle I was thinking of.

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,120
 And sometimes too vague, missing something or too strict,

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,280
 such as saying only digital technology, only via IT.

121
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,560
 But social engineering is not something new.

122
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,560
 This is my view, and we can discuss this maybe later somewhere in the corner

123
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
 because we only have 20 minutes.

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,600
 So the point was that it's nothing new.

125
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,760
 It's not only IT related.

126
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:34,040
 For example, the Spanish prisoner scam, which is OK, short info there,

127
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:43,560
 which is via prisoners that should be sending mails,

128
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,880
 should be telling people, please, if you give me money,

129
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,640
 so a kind of advanced fee scam,

130
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,240
 and then I will reward you because I'm a millionaire and I'm in prison.

131
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,320
 And this worked in some pubs, telling people, please, we need money to get him out,

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,800
 and then he will reward you later.

133
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,440
 But we need money first to do this.

134
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,320
 So these are the things that is nothing new, like grandparents scam as well.

135
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,160
 Could be on the door, person to person, no telephone scam, no IT, no Internet.

136
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
 So therefore, I was looking into just finding indicators.

137
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 So first thing, here you see the first three of the five.

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,720
 What you need to know here is that I have two perspectives, two views.

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
 That is the target person.

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,440
 I use targeted person and not victim because the person is targeted

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,600
 and becomes a victim if successful.

142
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,280
 So that's a different thing.

143
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,800
 And you see the capital letters, which is the RFC 2119,

144
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:07,160
 about how to put some operators, what is really important here.

145
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,800
 So first thing, target person is the human enabler.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,520
 And this was quite the key for me, a key enabler, meaning only if there is a human element

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,520
 that is exploited enables the attack.

148
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,880
 So some people say dumpster diving is social engineering.

149
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,320
 No, it's not for me.

150
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,360
 There's no human element in the majority of times.

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,400
 It's a pre-attack information gathering to then maybe make a social attack

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:47,200
 or to use this could be then social engineering to manipulate someone

153
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
 to throw something in the bin, which you later gather.

154
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
 So that could be social engineering.

155
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
 So just to give that a difference.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,800
 And this is for me the most important indicator.

157
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,200
 The second one is the attacker must initiate the communication,

158
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,200
 which could be three different types, like bidirectional,

159
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,600
 meaning there's really a communication.

160
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,000
 You receive a facsimile scam, like you just get a lot of money,

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,920
 please call this lawyer somewhere in Spain.

162
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,760
 And then you have bidirectional communication.

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,520
 Unidirectional, which is just the typical scams without not just a phishing email,

164
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,720
 spear phishing as well, where you just click on a link, for example.

165
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,400
 And indirect means that you would maybe drop a malicious USB, a bad USB,

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,680
 stick somewhere in the parking lot and hope that people picks it up,

167
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,040
 goes through the physical access measures, turnpile anything,

168
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,920
 then puts it into the laptop in the company,

169
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,120
 where you have firewalls protection, etc.

170
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,920
 But you can use the USB port and then have maybe a malicious payload there.

171
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,520
 So this is intentional communication, unawareness of the targeted person.

172
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,320
 So as well, you will see in the next slide, it goes on vice versa.

173
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,520
 So someone who is bribed and knows about that is not social engineered.

174
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,920
 He knows about this.

175
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,120
 So there's an unawareness factor about the real attacker's intention.

176
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,120
 It could be something different than we can think of social engineering.

177
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,720
 Then we have the malicious intent of the attacker.

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:13:00,320
 So some people say maybe a teacher who has the best interest of a pupil is social engineering.

179
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
 But that's the best interest.

180
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
 Well, we can discuss what is best teaching, etc. and education,

181
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
 but there's best interest like parents as well.

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 So is this social engineering? No.

183
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,520
 And the last one, which I will elaborate a bit more, is deceptive techniques.

184
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,920
 So this is the other part of unawareness.

185
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:32,520
 The attacker used deceptive techniques and get the targeted person comply with the request,

186
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,920
 which could be anything, but I won't go into detail in 20 minutes.

187
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
 So deceptive techniques.

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 We have many different types and a long list and it's not finished,

189
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
 but you can see it in literature.

190
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
 For example, Kevin Mitnick used name dropping.

191
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,120
 If you know someone's name in a company, then you call someone else and tell them,

192
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,120
 "Hey, this person, your colleague, wants this done, please help me."

193
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,320
 Or phishing.

194
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,120
 There are types of opportunistic social engineering.

195
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,320
 If you use phishing and jump onto a bandwagon, for example,

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,920
 GDPR compliance, that you send out a bank phish and telling the people,

197
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,120
 "You need to comply or your bank account will be deactivated."

198
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
 Such things.

199
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,120
 Or the pandemic as well, of course.

200
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,920
 Impersonation is quite interesting technique.

201
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,720
 Many people think about the Captain of Köppenick as quite a funny story,

202
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 which has real life roots, but the Standgericht Herholt, in English the drum,

203
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,520
 had a court martial, was really happening at the end of the World War II,

204
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:08,120
 where someone, a chimney sweeper from Chemnitz, used a military uniform from the military police

205
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:17,520
 and pretended to be military police, got other soldiers following him and then executing people.

206
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,920
 So this is about techniques.

207
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,320
 And one part of my definition is that a deceptive technique must have an underlying persuasion principles.

208
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
 One or more.

209
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
 There are different types.

210
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Of course, people who are into social engineering have heard about Cialdini.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,720
 It's from marketing and marketing uses some techniques that can quite easily be used for malicious intent.

212
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,320
 And if you think of marketing techniques, you have viral marketing, you can use dark patterns, etc.

213
00:15:51,320 --> 00:16:03,120
 And then we have a gray area and could be maybe not in the best interest of the targeted person, of the audience.

214
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,320
 So there are some, like I will go faster over it, but as well, this is nothing new.

215
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:20,920
 Loss aversion is something for the historians maybe, that Adam Smith already used.

216
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:28,320
 If there's a good, scarce, then people tend to be motivated to buy that product,

217
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,520
 even if they maybe at the moment don't need that.

218
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,720
 So this is something as well, nothing new.

219
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,320
 And Stajano and Wilson as well, an interesting paper.

220
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,920
 And for those who want to see some episodes, the real hustle is the series.

221
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,920
 Quite nice to see how they do.

222
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
 I would say most of them are social engineering in the wild.

223
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,720
 Okay, so far persuasion principles.

224
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
 That's for now.

225
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,720
 I don't know if you trust me that this is not a malicious link or failure or anything,

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,920
 but this is the link to my thesis, which has quite more interesting pieces.

227
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,920
 For example, I analyzed court documents looking for phishing in German court documents.

228
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:26,920
 Or I organized with some friends the social engineering poetry slam on one of the conferences or congresses a few years back.

229
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,120
 Okay, so far I think I am in time.

230
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,920
 Then thank you very much and stay safe.

231
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
 Yep.

232
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:45,720
 Okay, thanks a lot.

233
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,920
 So we have a couple of minutes so we can have a couple of questions.

234
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
 So if you have a question, line up here.

235
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
 You see the mic is here.

236
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,320
 There.

237
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,720
 Yeah.

238
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,920
 So, yes.

239
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,720
 If you want to talk privately with the Google Hacker,

240
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,120
 they promised to be on that side of the tent after the talk.

241
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,720
 So, yes, we have a question there.

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,120
 Hi.

243
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,920
 So malicious intent seems to be a bit vague.

244
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:36,320
 So your social engineering definition for your attempt to make it less vague is based on something that is also vague.

245
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,720
 Yeah, malicious intent is as well vague.

246
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,520
 I have in my thesis more examples.

247
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 So if you think it's not everything is monetary,

248
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,720
 but the majority I would think is monetary even if you have tried to harm the reputation of a company

249
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 and the reputation leads to some losses.

250
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,120
 No, it's again a bit financial, but there are many things.

251
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,920
 If you want to harass someone, then this could be as well.

252
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,920
 So, yes, you can do that.

253
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 But the whole social engineering depends on how you do it.

254
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,920
 So there are many things.

255
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,920
 And therefore this is vague as well.

256
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
 I agree.

257
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,920
 And maybe this would be important to have there more definition as well.

258
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
 But, yeah, thank you.

259
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
 Yes, we have time for one question more.

260
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
 So, please.

261
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
 Thank you for your talk.

262
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 I have done some assessments and we tried to get in the building and usually it works.

263
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:53,920
 But at the same time, I sometimes thinking how often does this happen for real?

264
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 With malicious intent.

265
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,920
 With malicious intent getting into the building.

266
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
 Because I have a get out of the jail free card with me.

267
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,920
 But a malicious attacker won't have and has to answer if they are caught to the police.

268
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 So the stakes are pretty high for an attacker.

269
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,920
 They are.

270
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
 As well, there's a challenge.

271
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 One thing is tailgating is nothing new.

272
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 You do this maybe of kindness.

273
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 Someone, okay, just come in or you get an access card without many questions or details.

274
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 But in the end, this was the challenge for me.

275
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 I need evidence.

276
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:43,920
 But how can I find evidence that is suitable, meaning has enough information what happened?

277
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 And this is quite difficult.

278
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
 Because some people don't want to talk about incidents in their company.

279
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,920
 And others say I heard from someone.

280
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,920
 And then you as a from researching from scientific perspective,

281
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,920
 you can't really tell if it's true or not.

282
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:07,920
 As an extreme, if you take some book of a security engineer and they tell a story,

283
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,920
 how can I prove or be sure that this is correct?

284
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,920
 And of course, some books are cited quite often.

285
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 But you can't be sure that it's correct.

286
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
 Citing is good.

287
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
 But what is the source?

288
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 Can I ask someone?

289
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 And even news articles are not very honest always.

290
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 Therefore, it was my approach to use the court documents.

291
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,920
 Because they have a truth-finding process in itself.

292
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 Okay.

293
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 We're unfortunately out of time.

294
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 You can, Google Hacker will be available here at the side of the stage for a while for like extra questions.

295
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 So let's give one more huge applause.

296
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 Thank you very much.

297
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
 Thank you very much.
