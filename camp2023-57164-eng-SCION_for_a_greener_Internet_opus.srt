3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:36,400
 Hello everybody, welcome to the last talk in this block.

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,400
 Who of you sent your stuff to the camp with BGP?

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,600
 Any user of BGP?

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
 I used it, it works great.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,480
 This is the routing protocol at camp for parcels.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,120
 But there's another BGP,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
 which is the routing protocol on the Internet for packets.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
 It's what has enabled the Internet for decades.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,880
 Mentor is going to tell us about what might replace BGP on the Internet,

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,520
 and how Scion might actually help to make the Internet greener.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,520
 Mentor, stage is all yours.

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,080
 Thank you.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,920
 [APPLAUSE]

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,720
 In the next 20 minutes or so,

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,840
 I will talk about how the Internet actually works currently,

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,120
 and what the Scion project in particular wants to change about it,

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
 and how that works.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,320
 I will gloss over a lot of the technical detail, unfortunately,

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
 because I have very little time.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 And I will try to be inclusive in this talk,

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:52,320
 which is why I will use metaphors that might stretch reality a bit.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,120
 I simply want to give you, those of you who have no idea actually

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,720
 how the Internet works, some idea of how it does.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 And for this reason, please bear with me if you have an idea

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 what I'm talking about, and the analogy doesn't quite fit.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
 All right.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,920
 So this is the outline of my talk.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,920
 First, we need to talk about how the Internet currently works.

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,920
 The status quo is that the Internet pretty much works

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 like a run-of-the-mill postal system.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:41,120
 Say, I want to send this plush owl to the Chaos Computer Club in Berlin.

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
 So what do I do?

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,920
 I simply put it in a box and add a sticker to that box

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,320
 with a destination where I write the postal address

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
 of the Chaos Computer Club Berlin,

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,720
 give it to the nice folks at the BGP,

39
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,720
 I think they're called the Camp Parcel Service or something,

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,320
 and then they worry about the rest.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,520
 I don't actually know the route which this packet will take.

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,720
 I only know that at some point in the future,

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,920
 I think a few days or so, if everything works as expected,

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,320
 my owl will arrive safely at Chaos Computer Club Berlin.

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,320
 So I don't know whether this packet will be forwarded

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,920
 via ZNNIC or via Fürstenberg.

47
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,520
 Maybe it can also take a detour through a logistics center

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,920
 in Frankfurt Oder.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,320
 I simply don't know.

50
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,120
 Interesting.

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
 I think I need to restart my slides

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
 because I just rebuilt them.

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:18,320
 A short timer, please.

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:38,520
 Here we go.

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,720
 So this is the perspective of the user that sends a packet

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,520
 over the current Internet.

57
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,120
 They simply know where to put the packet, the next postal office,

58
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,920
 and some magic happens in between

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,320
 and the packet arrives at its destination at some point.

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,720
 How does the postal system do this?

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,120
 Well, in very simple terms,

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,320
 and this is unfortunately not exactly how it works,

63
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
 unfortunately, let's assume that there's a post office

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,920
 in every town and each has a few courier connections

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
 to the surrounding post office in neighboring towns.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,520
 And each post office also keeps a huge list of all the towns

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,120
 in the country where it can look up into which neighboring post office

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 it should send a packet in order for the packet to move closer

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,720
 to its destination.

70
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,920
 So we send a parcel, this parcel will get forwarded intuitively

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,120
 step by step close to its destination

72
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
 until at some point it arrives in its destination city

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 where the postman knows exactly how to find the street address

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,920
 for this packet.

75
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,720
 So this distributed mechanism, this is pretty similar

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,320
 to how postal systems used to work in the past for several hundreds of years

77
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
 and works very well.

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,920
 A given post office only needs to know in which direction

79
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,920
 it needs to forward this packet and at some point the packet

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 will arrive actually in the city where it is intended to arrive in.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,720
 So in there it will be given to a postman or woman or person

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:31,720
 who will know how to deliver this packet.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 So resolving this analogy, the post offices are the internet core routers,

84
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,520
 the post offices.

85
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,920
 The local post office is your ISP which is where you will send your letters

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,520
 or give up your letters and receive new letters.

87
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
 And all post offices along the way are their own networks,

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,120
 their own autonomous systems, you have probably heard this term already.

89
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,920
 And all the neighboring post offices of a given post office are called its peers.

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,120
 And this huge list that each post office needs to maintain

91
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,520
 in order to know along which next hop a given packet needs to be sent

92
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,920
 is a routing table.

93
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,720
 And the BGP protocol, not those guys over there, but the BGP protocol

94
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:29,520
 is used to keep the routing table up to date.

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
 So what is wrong with this current internet?

96
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,920
 Well, depending on your perspective, not that much or maybe quite a lot.

97
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,720
 So the internet doesn't have the best reliability.

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,120
 So it has like three nines.

99
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,520
 It has a 99.9% reliability which sounds a lot but actually isn't that much.

100
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,120
 The good news about the internet, however, is that failures often last a few seconds

101
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,920
 which all of you have probably noticed that the website doesn't load,

102
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
 you hit F5 and it does load.

103
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 And you don't know where the problem was, but it's pretty likely that the problem

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,920
 was with this BGP mechanism where a failure wasn't needed to be resolved

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,520
 in order for routing to work again.

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,120
 There are other problems like security problems because BGP as a protocol

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,920
 was designed at a time where there was an implicit assumption

108
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,320
 that every participant on the network can be trusted.

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,720
 Actually in the BGP RFCs, in the first ones, the words trust or security

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,920
 or malicious or attack or something, you can grab for this and zero hits every time.

111
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,920
 The BGP was designed with a completely different internet in mind than we have today.

112
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
 Then there are some broken economic incentives.

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,320
 So as we all know, currently legislation, politics is lagging behind

114
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:03,920
 and they don't really enforce a proper carbon tax on carbon emissions

115
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,720
 which means that it's still the case today that you can buy electricity

116
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,920
 from non-renewable energy at lower prices than electricity

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,720
 that was created using renewable energy.

118
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,120
 And obviously market forces force network operators which have running costs

119
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,720
 and need this energy, force them to basically just buy the cheapest one,

120
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
 buy the discount of electricity.

121
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,920
 And this is obviously a problem, this is one of the points where the internet

122
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,120
 is currently not as green as it could be.

123
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,920
 But it's also hard for users to influence, like you don't really have a choice

124
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,320
 when some network in between decides to buy electricity from coal plants.

125
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,120
 You're basically stuck with this.

126
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,720
 Now, what is different with Scion?

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,320
 A lot of things they are trying to address, a lot of these problems,

128
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,520
 for instance also addressing security aspects, but I won't go into detail here.

129
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,320
 The key point where Scion differs from the BGP-based internet is that

130
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,920
 with Scion the senders get to decide along which paths the data gets forwarded.

131
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,320
 So again in our postal analogy, what we do instead of writing

132
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
 a regular street address there, we write steps there.

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,920
 We say, okay, the first step is the camp parcel service, the packet needs to go there,

134
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,320
 before the camp parcel service forwards it to Mildendorf,

135
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,920
 before Mildendorf forwards it to St. Annick and so on.

136
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,720
 And at some point it arrives at a point where a post person, a postman or post woman

137
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 can simply read the street address and exactly knows where it is.

138
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,120
 So this is the postal analogy.

139
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,520
 How does this help?

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:05,720
 How, translating this to data packets, what do we gain?

141
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,120
 We gain as users the ability to boycott networks that we know operate

142
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
 with a dubious sustainability record.

143
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,120
 And we can also support networks that we know operate sustainably,

144
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,720
 that have basically given assurances to other parties

145
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,920
 that they are only buying energy from renewable sources.

146
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,720
 And in our example, when we want to send this owl to Berlin,

147
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,920
 and we know that the operator of the connection between Ziedernick and Oranienburg,

148
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,520
 which is on the way to Berlin, uses a truck,

149
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,920
 and we also know that the operator that sends traffic or packets or parcels

150
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,520
 between Fürstenbeck and Oranienburg uses rail,

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,720
 then I can, as a user decide, please route my packets along Fürstenbeck,

152
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,720
 even if it takes a bit longer.

153
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,320
 But I know that the carbon footprint of this transaction will be smaller.

154
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,520
 There's an additional feature, of course, that I should mention.

155
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 This allows all sorts of things to do with this capability.

156
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,120
 For instance, for activists it's also interesting maybe to avoid

157
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,320
 routing via networks that are under dubious jurisdictions, etc.

158
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,720
 So you can optimize for more things.

159
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,920
 It's also interesting that CYON has been designed in a way

160
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,320
 that allows its core routers to operate more efficiently.

161
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
 In the post office analogy, it doesn't really keep these long lists

162
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,120
 with which it needs to decide where to send on which packet,

163
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,320
 it doesn't need to keep this list of all the towns in the country.

164
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,920
 It simply needs to follow the instructions that are written on the parcel.

165
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,120
 This comes at the expense, however, of 5 to 20% of bandwidth overhead,

166
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
 which sounds like a lot.

167
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,920
 It's not strictly an issue in wired communication,

168
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,920
 because increasing the speed doesn't really scale the electricity need of this.

169
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,520
 If you just put a new laser with a different wavelength on the same fiber,

170
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 the laser doesn't really need more energy in order to transport more data.

171
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,520
 But to basically visualize this overhead that this introduces,

172
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,720
 imagine putting this owl into a parcel where you write,

173
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 I don't know, the BGP guys over there onto it,

174
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,720
 and then put it into another parcel and write the next address.

175
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
 Actually, it's the other way around.

176
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 First, you would write the address of Berlin,

177
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
 put it into the next parcel, which you close,

178
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
 and then you write Oranienburg there, and then put it in a parcel,

179
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,520
 and then you write, I don't know, what did I say?

180
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,320
 Christenberg on it, put it in a parcel,

181
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
 and then on the last parcel you write BGP,

182
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,120
 and then they unwrap it, and so on.

183
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
 This obviously includes some overhead,

184
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,120
 and this is a visualization of what kind of overhead it entails.

185
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,920
 The technical details are a bit different, but this is how it works.

186
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,320
 Also, there's something that we should mention,

187
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,920
 is there's an embodied CO2 footprint,

188
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,920
 because SIRON router hardware is different from hardware

189
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,920
 that needs to run the regular internet.

190
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,120
 And obviously, rolling out SIRON globally would mean

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,520
 investing this, embodying this CO2 footprint of the data

192
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 and constructing all this hardware.

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,520
 Actually, numbers, how bad this will be, I'm missing,

194
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 I don't know about this.

195
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,520
 I think a rough ballpark is that a SIRON router will be about,

196
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 somebody about as much energy as an equivalent IP internet router.

197
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,520
 So maybe this sort of evens out,

198
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,520
 but you could feel free to research this yourself.

199
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 A third point which is actively being discussed in the SIRON project

200
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 is to attach carbon footprint of each individual hop

201
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 as metadata to the routing information

202
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 that then allows the user to construct paths

203
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,520
 that use the minimal amount of CO2,

204
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 and then let the user preferences cause pressure on network operators

205
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 to use renewable energy or to prefer the use of renewable energy.

206
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,520
 Another aspect of this would be that if they are being honest about

207
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 their current CO2 emissions used for routing their packets,

208
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,520
 and this changes dynamically basically,

209
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
 for example based on available wind,

210
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 then using this information could cause,

211
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 could help us route our packets around,

212
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 I don't know, how is it called, if the wind is gone,

213
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,520
 around calm weather patches where there is little wind,

214
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
 too little wind power for the wind turbines,

215
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 and so we simply avoid these regions and send our packets by different routes.

216
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 All in all this could sort of create a virtual circle

217
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,520
 where the network operators try to compete with each other

218
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 and try to be more green than their competitors,

219
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 basically reducing carbon emissions overall.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 Will this be enough? Will this really help us fighting climate change?

221
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 Well, so the global internet energy consumption in 2020 was 207 terawatt hours,

222
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,520
 which is sort of creates to a momentary power consumption of about 31 gigawatts,

223
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,520
 which is double that of the biggest hydroelectric plant in the world.

224
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,520
 The Three Gorges Dam in China produces about half this amount of power

225
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 if it's running at full capacity,

226
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 and this is excluding the power consumption of data centers,

227
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 so this is only network equipment, it's a rough ballpark figure.

228
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
 And this number is expected to grow to about,

229
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
 so right now it's 1% of all the global electricity,

230
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 and this number is expected to grow to 10% by 2030.

231
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,520
 So the bottom line is we don't really know how much Scion will help.

232
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
 We know that taking all the efficiency gains of routers into account

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 and subtracting the bandwidth overhead that it has,

234
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:27,520
 we end up at a number of around 10% more efficient,

235
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 10% less electricity use, let's say.

236
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,520
 Of course, we didn't really take into account the embodied carbon costs,

237
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,520
 and we also didn't really take into account the currently still elevated overhead,

238
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 energy overhead that is required for anti-virus to actually talk this protocol.

239
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 I mean, you can help.

240
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 So it probably wouldn't be enough to save the planet by itself, right?

241
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 But it's one step along the way,

242
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:07,520
 and we can't really afford to exclude things that don't promise that much reward,

243
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 but we can probably use this as an argument to still push towards a technology

244
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 that changes the way that the Internet is currently used

245
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 and at the same time empowers users in a way that allows them,

246
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 allows additional forces to push towards carbon neutrality.

247
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 In this talk, I have left out a bunch of stuff which we could talk about offline afterwards.

248
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,520
 Of course, there's a lot of technical detail that I glossed over pretty much.

249
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,520
 There are questions about how a SCI-internet would be governed.

250
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,520
 There are also different incentives for different Internet stakeholders.

251
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,520
 Your ISP might not be that happy if you always decide to send your traffic a certain way,

252
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 because right now it's them who decide how to forward it.

253
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,520
 Anyway, how to get involved?

254
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,520
 So the SCI-in project itself has been under development at ETH Zurich since 2009.

255
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
 It's open source and standardization is underway at ITF also.

256
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 It's deployed in the wild.

257
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,520
 The Swiss Secure Finance Network will migrate exclusively to SCI-ins,

258
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 so all the Swiss banks will stop using the old system and exclusively migrate to this system by 2024.

259
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 There are additional networks.

260
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,520
 So one is a production network that is run by a commercial company that is selling this hardware also.

261
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,520
 And an education and research network that you guys can join.

262
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,520
 And also there's an experimental playground where you can play around with this technology,

263
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,520
 but it still uses the regular BGP-based Internet underneath and works via VPN links.

264
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,520
 You can play around with this under these URLs and get involved.

265
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,520
 It's probably best if you join this Matrix channel where SCI-in development is discussed.

266
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,520
 And I think with that I'm about done.

267
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,520
 You can also reach out to me at this email or this masternode address.

268
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,520
