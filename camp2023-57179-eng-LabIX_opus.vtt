00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello and welcome everybody to the Nordic Stage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Hafnum, who's a university student who's studying cyber technology,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 is going to talk about how to make a difference in the world of technology.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Hafnum, who's studying cyber technology, is going to talk about how to found an internet exchange

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 he founded LabX from his HackerSpace, Labitet and Copenhagen.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Welcome with me, Hafnum.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Thank you. I would like to tell you about how we created an internet exchange in my local HackerSpace.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 First, why I'm making this talk.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 As a newcomer to the networking world, network routing and similar,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 I found it really difficult to find good information on IXP operations.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 I could read some things from some network operator meetups and some of the commercial internet exchanges,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 but it was really high level, so everything was a bit difficult to understand on what is it exactly.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Also, when you need to get an AS number and other IP resources delegated,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 there is some administration and it differs from region to region.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 In Europe, it's ripe and there are some policies that they have.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 So, what is the LabX internet exchange?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Well, it is a community run internet exchange in Labitet, in our nice little HackerSpace in Copenhagen.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 We use it as a place to learn network routing.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 It is a very difficult topic to get started in.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 There are some projects that can help you, like DN42,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 but if you want to do routing where you talk with the real world and not via VPNs,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 then you need to pay a lot of money to get into a data center

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 or find some project where it is available for you, also closely nearby,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 that you can actually start doing network routing and bring a small server, perhaps.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So, yes, you can learn some BGP. This is where I learned my BGP, at least, in our HackerSpace.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 You can play with our router server. It has its own nice AS number.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 You can get started in getting IP resources like AS numbers and IP addresses.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 You can play with BGP security. This is one of the things where it is really difficult to actually get a grasp on,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 unless you start playing with it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 There are some really nice talks around the world about RPKI and filtering strategies.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 But if you also want to actually try it, it is kind of difficult to get outside your own home lab.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 Also, very soon we will change it to 9K MTU. The default in the world is 1500 MTU.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 There is an expert of C-draft for how to change it.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 As soon as I get all the way through that and I notify our members, I will change.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 We will also get that. It has a few advantages compared to 1500.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So, what does your HackerSpace need to have an Internet exchange?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 You need a friendly uplink. Maybe you have multiple. That would be very cool.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 That is because if they do not necessarily like you, it is very hard to update your policies.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Their own policies that allows your IX clients to be announced to the world.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 So, having a member that works in your uplink really helps.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 But maybe be good friends and give them a beer. Some people you know.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 You also need some server housing. You need a rack. We have a used rack.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 They are available in multiple places. We also have a used layer 2 switch.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 That is the one marked with my better drawing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 You need at least 3 peering clients. This is the magic number of getting anything done.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 When you talk about an IX, Bright requires it.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 P-ingDB requires it. The IXP database requires you to even be registered.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Or consider having an entry in each of their databases.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Of course, this is also a HackerSpace. You need to have more than one person.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Because when a person stops coming to the HackerSpace, it will die.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 That is the usual thing with community run projects.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Of course, you need to have some documentation and have some people who like to run this.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 What is an Internet Exchange? The very simple version is a VLAN on a layer 2 switch.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Then we have a few of connector networks.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 That is operators with their own AS number and prefixes.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 This was the difficult part. If you don't know much about networking.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 This was a bit of a large step to have.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 But if you know what I talked about, this is what you needed.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 All these 5 slides.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 But let me explain the Internet a bit.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 It took me years to understand the Internet. I am still learning a lot.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 To newcomers, let's explain some things.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 How do you do Internet routing?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 I assume you know some networking like IP addresses.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 You get your IP prefix allocated. You find the host facility.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 You install your machine. Then you set up your external BTP routing daemon.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 That can come in proprietary and open source solutions.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 You need to find some peers to connect with.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 We will find a transit that allows you to connect to the rest of the Internet.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 If you are located in Copenhagen, how do you have a connection to Berlin?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 You need a direct fiber to some place.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Some companies do this as their business.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Profits, I guess.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Let's set a scenario.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 You are an eyeball ISP in Copenhagen.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 An eyeball ISP is you have customers with eyeballs that consume content.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 That could be watching their favorite movies, for example.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 You need to get content from the content providers.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 The people having the movies.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 You need some IP addresses for customers and servers.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 To be able to be reached from the Internet.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 You also need some server housing and some fibers around.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 I won't go into that.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 This is the nicest image I found yet.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 This is an example of networking.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Some peers and transit providers.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Don't bother with the names of them.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 You can have, for example, AS number one in the total left side.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 They have some prefixes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 They can be announced up to the uplink via the next one in the line.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Which then in turn is announced further.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 This is called a transit because you don't have a direct connection to everybody else.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It also goes the same way.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 You get traffic from everybody else.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 An autonomous system.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 The best description I found was in an Internet standard.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 It says a connected group of one or more IP prefixes.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 One by one or more network operators.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Which has a single and clearly defined routing policy.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 I'll get a bit more into the details of that.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 One or more network operators and you have some prefixes.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 An autonomous system is identified by a unique 16 or 32 ASN.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 An autonomous system number also called ASN.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 We use it to say hello, I'm AS 211153.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 That's my personal AS.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 If you look that up, you can find out what my routing policies are.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Also what addresses do I have.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 A routing policy, this is the simplified version, is that we have some objects called Internet routing registry.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 We have them in our local regional Internet database.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Like RIPE in our case.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 At least in Copenhagen.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 These could say that these IP prefixes should be disneyed to me.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 And I would accept prefixes disneyed to and from my business customers.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 AS something something and AX something something else.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 This is pretty much it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 There's other details you can go into.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Very simplified.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 I accept that the people or the organizations behind me can be announced through me.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Also I have included when I found a lot of good readme tools, I have included in the bottom.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 You can find my slides on the program page.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 We also have peering and transit as I mentioned.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Peering is that we agree that we only send traffic distance to each other.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 You have prefixes here, I have prefixes here.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 You have some content and I want some content.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 We have a direct connection to each other and we peer.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 This is most usually free.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 There's a small asterisk that costs some things to pull a fiber in the data center.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Many data centers take a monthly fee for having a cross connect as we call it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And of course you also need to buy your own optics and things like that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 We also have transit.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 This is the people who like to transport traffic from you to other networks.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Also the other way.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 But it costs something per megabyte.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Sorry, megabit I wrote.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And of course we would like to avoid this as much as we can.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 But again we can't be connected to every network in the world.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 So this creates a little of a dilemma on where should we actually connect.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Who should we peer with? Does it really make sense to connect with this small provider?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Do we actually want to pay for our part of it?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 We have the Internet Exchange.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 I will get back to that question in a small second.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 The Internet Exchange is that we would like to keep local traffic local.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 This is the main reason.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Because when you have transit providers you sometimes get the issue of having the trombone effects.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 I included an image here where it says this is a map of the United States.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Some of it.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And we have three cities here.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 We have Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 The traffic goes from Los Angeles to San Francisco. I hope you can see the arrows also.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 But it does not go directly.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 It goes all the way to some good amount of kilometers to San Francisco.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 This creates latency.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 This isn't just unnecessary.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 It may be just because your transit provider doesn't have a direct connection between these two cities.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Or maybe they made a routing mistake. That happens.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 So we get lower latency if we are directly connected to each other.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 An Internet Exchange also makes it more easy to connect to other networks.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 I always said the recurring cost of data centers.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 The simplified topology of an Internet Exchange looks kind of like this.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 We have this mystery meet me room as we call it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 We have some providers.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 There is also a cloud service down here.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 It will probably be a content provider.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 We all have one connection into our meet me room.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Instead of having connections to each other all the way.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 This is mostly how it looks.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 But there are some other things about Internet Exchanges.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 I would like to explain a bit on some of the characteristics.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 First we can have our bilateral peering.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 It is called also many to many.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Where I connect to each and everybody I would like to peer with.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But instead I go to multilateral.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 I have one connection to a route server.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 That makes sure I can connect to the other ones.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 As everybody else does.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 We have this central point.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 You can of course have low balancing and similar things.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 It is not a single point of failure.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 The very simple version of this is that you have one machine in here.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 The route server is for aggregating our control plane traffic.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 We don't send our traffic over the route server itself.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 We make sure the routes can be distributed by the route server.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 The advantages of this is that now we have lower maintenance.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 We don't need to necessarily have a lot of injuries with each and every peering client.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 We can connect immediately to newcomers.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 If we have this small network that would like to connect with me.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And I don't necessarily want to pay the cost.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 We can connect immediately with each other.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 As soon as they jump on the route server.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Given that I am also present.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Then traffic does flow.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 So we don't have to go through the transit.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 We can also have some debugging tools.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And actually see more of what is going on.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 The image shows how you can do it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Of how it happens.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Our route server looks like this.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 It is a very small machine.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 It is also a very small space.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 It is like a thin client.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 It uses 6 watts of power.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 We chose this because we had it in our hands already.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 It is not that powerful.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 It can run Debian.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It is fine I guess.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 We use the config parser called a route server.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 To configure our route server.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 This is where we keep the list of our clients.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Then we generate the config that BERT uses.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 BERT is the program actually getting the routes in.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And distributing the routes to our peers.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 As well as clients can also use BERT.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 It is a general purpose routing daemon.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 It is totally fine.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 You can use it as a route server.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But you can also use it as a client.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 I use it as a client as well.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Server hosting.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 For our case we have our project called Labicolo.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 It is our co-location facility.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 It is intended for small embedded devices.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 We use it for APIs and APUs.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 This is due to power restrictions.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 We would like to keep the cost low.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 This is hobby projects.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 We don't necessarily need beefy servers.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 They are also readily available.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Not that expensive to have.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Again, this is the same picture I used.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 It looks awful.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 We have this Cisco SK300.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 We use it because it was already there.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Again, it is free.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 You can also do Mac port filtering.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 That is one of the requirements.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 One of our peering requirements.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 To avoid loops in the routing.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 You can make it more pretty than we have.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 You can also clean it up a bit more.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Our peering policy.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Every exchange has a peering policy.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Just like you as a network provider.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 You also have some policy.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I only want the traffic you mean to go to me.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I don't want my neighbors traffic necessarily.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 I do want my neighbors traffic.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 But you have to pay.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 This is based on the local Internet exchange.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Peering policy.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 It looks very much like it.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 We allow the infinite frames.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 IPv4, IPv6 and ARP.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 That is the usual suspects.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 We do not like proxy ARP and OSPF.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 And other kinds of these.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 We only want to know BGP stuff.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 We want routing and we want data traffic.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 We don't want a lot of...

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Let's for example say DCP.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 But we only allow one kind of routing protocol.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 BGP.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 You could use other ones.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 But the Internet in general uses BGP.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So it makes things much more easy.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Again the MAC address filtering.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 We also do not like that...

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 If you connect via VPN we need the full MTU.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 You have to be physically present.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 This is not a virtual Internet exchange.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 These also exist to play around with network routing.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 They are fine.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 I have nothing against them.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 But for our case we wanted to have machines physically located.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Virtual Internet exchanges have the issue of...

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Now you are depending on transits to somewhere.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 And that transit can take a long time.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Still a nice place to learn if you are interested.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 So an Internet exchange client can also have their own policies.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Here is a very high overview of how they are listed.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Of some categories.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Open is...

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 We just like peering with everybody.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 This is when you hop on to the route server.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 We have the lecture where you will talk with us first.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And we are usually open to this.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 We may have our own internal protocols that deny us this.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 This is where you do direct peering connections.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And set up a separate entry for each and everyone.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 You can also have restricted.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 This could be a transit or a very large network.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 They have some security policies or similar that restrict them.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 That means you have to contact them and maybe you need to be a large entity.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 To be considered.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 I have seen this issue personally.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 With some large providers not necessarily wanting to peer.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Even though a network provider did want to peer.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 It didn't make sense to buy transit.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 How do you get Internet resources allocated?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 I have this image of a cake.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 IANA owns all the Internet addresses in the world.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 You don't necessarily own the ones.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 You just get them allocated.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 This is the regional Internet registry.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 There are five of these in the world.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Spread out through our world.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 This is RIPE in our case.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Then we have the local Internet registry.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 From what I can understand, a RIPE specific thing.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 As an end user, you don't talk directly with RIPE.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 The local Internet registry talks with RIPE for you.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 If you want to be part of the RIPE NCC, you can pay the fee.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 For a project, it doesn't make sense.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 It is for network operators or people who like to pay some money.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 It is not cheap, but it is not that expensive.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 As a network operator, that could be an ISP or content provider.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 You want your addresses to be globally routable.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 This is where I say I have this content and you have your customers who want this content.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 The traffic should go through the Internet.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 I should be able to send traffic to you.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Then you can handle it from there.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 If everything is requested to me, I need an IP address.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 A source IP address to send it back to.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 This is where the routing takes over.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 If you have an ISP, you don't necessarily need to have globally routed IP addresses.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 The reason you don't necessarily need it is that you just need to have a unique identifier

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 for your Internet Exchange members for their own routers.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 You don't want it to be mixed up with anybody else in the world.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 This is why you request some IP addresses.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 It is not for hosting servers.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 I didn't explain the cake.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 IANA has all the addresses.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 RIPE gets a little piece of the cake.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Then your local Internet registry gets a little piece of that cake.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Then you get a tiny piece of the local Internet registry cake.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 There are a lot of addresses in the world.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 This is only illustrative.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 It is fine.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 I use /24 for a lot of things and /48 prefix for a lot of things.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 We also have the RIPE database.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 The object you need to create is an organization object.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 If you already have one for your HackerSpace, this is one thing I did wrong.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 We already have an organization since we do some BGP routing and announce our members.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 You should just use your existing org object.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 If you don't have one, you should create an org object.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 You also need maintainers.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 This is a list of people that get access to change your routing policy.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Then a person is a person.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 You also need a...

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 At least it is optional.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 A normal client, a network operator needs ASSETs.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 This is where your routing policy lies.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 You don't need it for an Internet exchange.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 It is recommended if someone filters for these kinds of things.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 This is where we look into are you allowed to announce XYZ prefix.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 XYZ is a number, not a prefix. That is called a route object if you want to tie a prefix and an AS number together.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 I couldn't find any of this. It was just a thing I learned.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 You need to give the name of your Internet exchange.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 They will ask you if you want a route server as soon as you say you want an Internet exchange.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Then you say yes, but then you also need to have some...

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 There are also some requirements.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 For a route server, you need an AS number.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Your peers need to connect to the route server.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 This cannot be a private resource.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 One thing is that you should request a 16-bit AS number.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 They are available if you ask directly for them.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 We are running out.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 By default, you will be assigned a 32-bit AS number.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 It does not matter in most cases if you just take your Linux machine and put it up.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 However, if someone brings a really old machine, they do want a 16-bit AS number.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 They were just not set up for 32-bit, so it won't work.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 A bonus is that a Danish number plate also fits on a 16-bit AS number.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 I have really been considering buying one and putting it up on our rack.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Stupid things.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 Then you will also be asked if you need prefixes.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Then you say yes, please.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 So, RIPE does not give IPv4 addresses out to be globally routed.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 There is a long, long waiting list.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 We have been exhausted the IPv4 space for a long time.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 That is why you say yes, this is not to be routed.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 This is specifically to be announced within our pre-regulation.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 This is the actual message I was sent.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 I said yes.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 You should give these printers already and they will do pretty good.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Also, what size do you want of addresses?

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 You have to confirm that your COLO facility actually has connectivity.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 I guess it makes sense.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 I just didn't think of that.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 I had to scramble and ask three people where this is.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 A few days later, I could get hold of it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 A lot of delays you can actually avoid to get hold of your contract.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Again, the magic number was three customers.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 If you have more than that, you are good.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 But if you have less, then you need one more.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 If you have two people, you can peer with each other.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 It doesn't make sense to set up all these and all the administration.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 They don't need to be connected directly at that time you set it up.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 They need to agree and say yes, I will definitely join as soon as I can.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 We also need to give the postal address.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 The address is apparently able to receive mail and then a contact person.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Their organization and phone number.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 I was just casually writing emails, so I didn't really think of these.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 But they are pretty good pointers.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 How do you find a local internet registry?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 You ask your local network wizard.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 I have a few, not that many, but they know the magic of the internet.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 This is also where I got pointed to the free transit project when I got my own AS number.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 It's a nice project from Open Factory.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 There are some really nice people behind it.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 There are also people behind it that are on this camp.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 I hear there will also be an internet exchange by some of them.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Run on the camp soon, hopefully.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Yes, I have a bias that I personally know some of them.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 But if you want to find a local internet registry service,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 you hop into your search engine and you search for that term.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Some people are happily taking your money to facilitate this.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 It doesn't really cost that much to get started.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 For me it was 25 euros, personally.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 It's fine.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 If it's another project, then you need to...

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 If it's a commercial actor, then you probably need to pay a bit more.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Similar projects are all the community-run internet exchanges in the world.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 There are commercial actors, many.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 But a lot of the internet exchanges are just some networking people meeting over a beer

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 and saying, "Yes, we need this."

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And they made this.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 There's also some hosting facilities.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 KoloKlo in Amsterdam, that's case-based, a commercial rack.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Then we also have a VGP.WTF in Warsaw, HackerSpace.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 Regional Learn in Berlin also exists, and also can provide some VGP things.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 This is not internet exchanges, but these are places that do network routing.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 And may also have some people that can point in the right directions.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 I have probably missed a lot of nice projects, but this is the ones I found.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 I would like to say thank you to my collaborators.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 This was actually a school project.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 I managed to get ECTS points for it anyway.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Olivia and Daniel, we have created this together.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Then we also have Jowe from Street Transit Projects, who really help with all the right things.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 It was a whole new land for me.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And then we also have Asperon, my local network wizard, for sharing a lot of knowledge and a lot of pointers.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Here are some good resources.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 I found PNGDB and BGP tools.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 I use them almost every day.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 I would encourage you to go to your local network operator meetup.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 In Denmark it's called DKNOG, and in Germany it's called DENOG.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Lots of nice people.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 You can meet a lot of nice people, and usually if you say I will buy you a beer,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 then they will explain the whole thing to you on whatever subject you want.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 We also have the RIPE Academy.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 This really helped me in understanding IPv6 and BGP security.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 They are actually pretty nice.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 You can also get a certificate if you want.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 That costs some money though.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 But you can take the courses for free.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 That's a bit more. We have the Network Startup Research Center.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 That's also helped me.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 We have NLNOG with their PNG, BGP Filter Guide, and NLNOG Ring for search.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 How does the internet reach you?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Then we have Eurex with their B-Cops and their wishlist on what to buy.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 The $1000 Internet Exchange presentation on how shitty hardware can you buy.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 It turns out we can buy really shitty hardware, from my experience.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 If you want to find us, we actually have a self-organization called BGP Enable Hacker Spaces

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 at Shell 4 here at 17 today.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 You can also meet me at Bornhack Village and also at Bornhack next year.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Or you can meet us in Labitat.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 We would very gladly talk to you.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 We also have a website.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 We have a PNG DPA entry, of course.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 If you want to write an email, throw it at me.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 If someone is interested in sponsoring this, I paid everything out of my own money.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 It was doable, but I'm a student, so money is limited.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 We very much like stickers.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 That is a huge shortage.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Perhaps a second uplink on hardware.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 The next thing we want to look at is...

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 I should definitely look at getting up a looking glass.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Participants can see how it works, how their routing happens.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 It's a small Internet exchange, so ARP is not that large right now.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 It's not a problem right now, but it can become a problem.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 There's a lot of ARP broadcasts when you have Internet exchanges.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 We need more documentation.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 I would like to set up RPKI relay.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 I've set it up personally, but not at the IX.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 We have already filled our own uplink, so it's not that much of a problem.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Thank you for listening.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 This was my talk.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Hopefully there are a few questions.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Exactly.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Some time for Q&A.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 If there are any questions, please put your hands up.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 I'm going to repeat them for the audience online.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Yes?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 Just a second.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Thank you so much.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 The peers you're peering with, are they located in the same building?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Or are they having a fiber directly to you, or a wavelength on a fiber, or how do you connect to your peers physically?

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Let me spool up a tiny bit.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 If you look up in the imaginary north of the image, there are all the machines.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 They're all connected by... Yes, they're physically present.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 Everybody has a APU2, Raspberry Pi, or small machines that are physically present.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 So your peers are only in the same building?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Yes.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 So you're not peering with other networks?

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 No, that would be very nice, but it's also a small project.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Next question.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Do you know of any DIY internet access providers or hosting providers in Denmark that you could peer with or connect with?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Network providers?

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Most are happy to peer with you, given that you're present at a place they are present.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 If you go to one of the larger data centers in Denmark, most definitely yes.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Many have an open peering policy and you can just go right ahead.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 It requires a bit of money to get into a data center though.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 So that's why sponsoring is so important, am I right?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Yes, you need some sponsoring.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Any other questions? We have time for one more, if there are any.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 If not, you can probably find him in the Bornheg village and you can ask him some more,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 especially if it's like private questions because you want to do the same project.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 Thank you everyone for listening. Big applause.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.360
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.940
 (upbeat music)
