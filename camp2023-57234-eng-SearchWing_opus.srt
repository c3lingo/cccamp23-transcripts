 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Welcome to the Bittenboim stage.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 We are continuing our program with the next talk by Petruselius and

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Philippe, who are explaining to us what the Search Wing project is and

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 what it is doing for civil emergency operations with drones.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Welcome, enjoy the talk.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 [APPLAUSE]

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 >> Yeah, hi and welcome.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 My name is Philippe and who are you?

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Petruselius.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And we are part of the Search Wing team and we build drones, UAVs,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 unmanned aerial vehicles for search and rescue.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It's really nice to see you all here, the great interest in our work and

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 we are really happy to present our work here.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Thanks to all the people who made this talk possible to the whole Bittenboim

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 village.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Yeah.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So short overview about our talk.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So we will talk a little bit about motivation, why we do it, why it's

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 important to do it.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Then we will show you in detail our drone, how it works, how it looks like.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I mean, you can see it over here already, but we will also present some

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 pictures.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We talk a little bit about our organization.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We have an association now.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Then we will talk about the past and the present and maybe a little bit

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 about the future.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And then we also go into detail about image processing, which we do, and

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 future work, stuff we want to do in the future.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So what motivates us?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 More and more people are fleeing, are on the move for several reasons.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 One reason is war and terror, poverty, climate change.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 There are a lot of reasons why people flee, and some people flee over the

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 ocean because they have no other way to get to safety.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And here you can see a map and some numbers about people on the move.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 What's important to see here is that a lot of people die, so they are very

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 dangerous routes for people.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So it's our responsibility to help these people.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And what you can see here too is that there are multiple routes.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Even through the Mediterranean Sea, there are multiple routes which people

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 take.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 For example, there is a route via Libya, which is a big war zone.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Then there's a route via Tunisia.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 But then you also see on the left there's a route via the Mare Inge von

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Gibraltar.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But also people come to Greece.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And what you don't see here at the moment is, for example, the English

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Channel or the Atlantic Route, where people go to the Canary Islands, for

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 example, from Senegal.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 So it's very dangerous and we should support these people.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 What we see at the moment is that almost all states withdraw from the sea.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 They leave it to a civil fleet to support people on the move.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Here you can see a few organizations which we are actually working with.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 They have very different vessels.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Here on the left, it's an old picture.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Actually, now the ship is run by SOS Humanity, but before the Sea Watch

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 had the Sea Watch 4.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Then you can see the Alan Kodi, the ship of Sea Eyes.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's also not a present situation right now.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So this ship is now owned by somebody else.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 But there's also a rescue ship, a small sailing boat, which operates right

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 now in front of Lampedusa.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So what we want to do, we want to support a lot of NGOs in different

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 situations with our system.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And this then has some implications for our work.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Of course, there's the government or multiple governments doing work in

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 the Mediterranean too.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But what they mostly do, they fund corrupt and bad people, which you can

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 see on the left is so-called Libyan Coast Guard.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They get, for example, infrastructure, for example, vessels.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And then on the right, you see that Frontex, EU border agency more or less,

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 they operate drones in the Mediterranean Sea or above the sea.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 There you can see some tracks of these drones.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But the image data is actually not public, so they only use it to inform,

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 for example, the Libyan Coast Guard about cases.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And then they start to do pullbacks, so they bring people back in the war

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 zone and not to a safe place where they actually belong.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Here you can see, get an impression of the area where the NGO boats operate

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 in this Mediterranean Sea in front of Lampedusa and Malta.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So it's quite a long way with the shitty boat to get to a safe place.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And then you can also see that's a very big area the ships have to cover.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And right now it's quite low-tech what the NGOs do.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They go on rusty ships.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 They go to sea, and then they use the ice to check for people on the water.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Sometimes or most of the times they use binoculars.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Then the next technical device they have is radar, but the radar not always works

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 or it's not as great as we want it to be because they are rubber boats.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Or the people on the move, they use rubber boats,

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 so there's no real reflection of the radar signal.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So it's really hard to make out cases by radar.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Then the next tool we have are airplanes.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Some NGOs operate airplanes over the sea.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 They of course can spot people, but they use binoculars,

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 ice or cameras to spot these people,

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and they can only operate in very good conditions.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Then of course another tool we have is mobile phone,

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 but the mobile phone only works for a few miles out into the ocean,

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and then people are more or less disconnected.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Some people have satellite phones and can call, for example, alarm phone.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Alarm phone is a hotline for people on the move,

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 so you can call them and tell them, "Hey, we are in distress.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Please forward this information to the Coast Guard or the Civil Fleet."

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But of course you have to have, for example, a satellite phone.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Some countries forbid satellite phones,

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 so in some situations it's hard to get satellite phones.

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Then it's possible to use satellites to detect cases on the water too,

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 but this is a really expensive process,

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 and it's also not as fast as, for example, an airplane.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Nowadays we start to use drones to find people,

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 but to this I come later.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Here you can see, for example, how people on a ship try to find people,

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 but as you can imagine, this on a moving ship, rocking ship,

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 is really a tiresome process and also prone to errors.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 We actually want to show the video.

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 What we do, we build drones for search and rescue.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Here you can see our drone in operation.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 But how did this all start?

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It actually started in this wonderful community.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Some people saw that NGOs and other people started to do search and rescue at sea

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 with this quite low-tech approach.

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 These people are from the chaos community.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 They thought, "Okay, hey, we have skills,

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and there's quite a lot of free software and open hardware

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 which we can use to build a drone that helps in this use case."

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So it actually started 2017.

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 We gave a talk here and the project started.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 What's happening right now?

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Yesterday evening we got a call from one of the ships.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They have a drone near to Lampedusa on the vessel,

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and they did a search flight from the vessel.

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So the drones are actually in operation.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Then there's another ship where we have two drones,

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 which are right now in the so-called Sa zone,

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 so the zone where we actually search for people,

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 and we are waiting for the next flight of one of our drones.

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Right now three drones are in operation,

138
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 but in the past, of course, we did missions and test missions.

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Here you can see a small overview.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 We did the first mission with a rescue ship.

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They operate from a small sailing vessel.

142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I think the person who actually did the mission is also somewhere here.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Then we tried to do a mission with CI,

144
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 but unfortunately our system failed before we actually went to sea.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Then you earlier saw the SeaWatch 4,

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 so we went on a short trip to the shipyard with SeaWatch 4,

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 where we intensively tested our system,

148
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 so one of the latest prototypes.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Then the last two missions we did with Mission Lifeline,

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 they operate near the Canary Islands,

151
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and they operated the drone in 2021 for one week,

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 and then now they operated two drones for three months.

153
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Now I want to tell you a little bit about the drone,

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 and we want to show you a short video about the process.

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I guess it's a little bit hard to see,

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 but the idea is that we operate at sea,

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 therefore there's a lot of water.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 For example, from a small sailing vessel,

159
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 normally we give two drones to the vessel if there's enough space.

160
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Then we have a small tablet,

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 which we use for planning of the actual search pattern,

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 so normally we know about the case,

163
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 or know some information about the case,

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 and want to fly somewhere and fly a search pattern there.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It's not a big drone.

166
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You have to invest right now 1,700 euros for one drone.

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's quite wind resistant.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Here you can see the hand launch of the drone,

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 where you just throw the drone in the air,

170
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 and then it starts to automatically fly the search pattern.

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 We fly in 550 meters.

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Of course, we can also change this,

173
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 but in this height we see the most area,

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 and then our cruise speed now is actually a little bit faster.

175
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Then we see an area,

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 our ground resolution is 20 centimeters per pixel right now.

177
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Here you can see how a search pattern could look like.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We can cover roughly 200 square kilometers with our two cameras.

179
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Then we have a base station where we always have a connection to the drone

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 and can also change the flight pattern in flight

181
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 if there's a need for that.

182
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Then the drone automatically comes back to the ship,

183
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 and then the drone pilot initiates the landing.

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Right now we do the landing by hand,

185
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 so we have a remote control and land the drone next to the ship.

186
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It's even possible in very rough conditions,

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 for example waves of two meters are not a big problem.

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Then the drone actually lands in the water

189
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 because we don't want to endanger any people on the ship.

190
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Then we start the image download and automatic processing of the images.

191
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Here you can see an old version of our system,

192
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 and one crew member goes through all the images we have.

193
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Just to recap, we actually have a flying camera.

194
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 We can go 100 kilometers.

195
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's waterproof because we land in the water.

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The flying is automatically, so it's not autonomous.

197
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Then we have computer vision, but it's offline.

198
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Of course, it's all free and open source software and hardware,

199
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 so if you want to build a drone, you can do this.

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Here's a short overview about our system.

201
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 We actually have this frame. We buy it in Asia.

202
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Then we have a waterproof box you can see in the middle.

203
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Then we have a flight computer based on an STM32.

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Then we have a Raspberry Pi with two cameras connected.

205
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The Raspberry Pi then gets data from a flight computer,

206
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and then we can fuse this data with the image data

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 and, for example, then tell where we took the image or at which time.

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Of course, we also have a telemetry module or transceiver

209
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 to stay in contact with the drone,

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 but we only use this for, for example, position data and not for image transmission.

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Then in front of our plane there's a big battery,

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 which weighs more or less one kilo.

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 In the back there we have the motor,

214
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and of course we have a few servos to control the plane.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Then here you can see how we actually do the planning,

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 so we use free software here.

217
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 It's called QGroundControl. It's a QT app,

218
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 and you can draw a pattern which the drone then actually flies through.

219
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Then we also developed a little bit of software

220
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 to actually take a look at the pictures we take.

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Here you can see maybe a picture with one big ship,

222
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and then maybe you could, or normally we ask people to count the ships in the image.

223
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I think this is now really hard,

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 but what you can see that it's really hard to actually see the small ship.

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 So the big ship is the SeaWatch 4, and then we have a small rip,

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 which is next to the SeaWatch 4,

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 but with our camera system it's really hard by human eye to make out this ship.

228
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Therefore we have this system to take a look at the images,

229
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and then also the image processing to give hints in the image to actually see the case.

230
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Here you can now see, for example, that we highlighted this case.

231
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 You can only see a few pixels of the case.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now I give over to Julian, I think.

233
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Thanks. I want to show you a few bits about the boat detection process we developed at Searchping.

234
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 You saw already in the previous images the result of it.

235
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 We have a software which shows the image and an overlay with the rectangle around where the boat is.

236
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The steps I want to show you describe this process, how to generate these boxes.

237
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There are a few things we thought, or we developed some knowledge, and I want to share this with you.

238
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 We can roughly build this process, and it's built out of five steps.

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The first step is taking the actual image, then we download the images after the plane has landed,

240
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 and then we do the actual boat detection.

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 After this detection we do the fourth step, it's offline tracking,

242
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 which combines all the information we created in the previous step, and then in the end we visualize this.

243
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So how do we do the actual image capturing?

244
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 As Philipp already said, there is a Raspberry Pi board in the plane which has two cameras connected to it.

245
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It got eight megapixels, and this results in an altitude of 550 meters,

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 and a ground resolution of roughly 20 centimeters per pixel to 35 centimeters per pixel.

247
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 We can cover with both cameras a sweep width of two kilometers.

248
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 We take one photo every two seconds, and we also thought a bit about the exposure control,

249
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 because normally the exposure control for cameras is very optimized for big objects inside the image,

250
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 but as we wanted to detect very small objects, they tend to get overexposed,

251
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 so we really try to underexpose the images to get not overexposure of the boats,

252
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 to have some more contrast in the image.

253
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 So the second step after the actual image taking is then already the download of the image,

254
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 which is done after the plane has landed next to the ship, we get it on board, and then we download the images.

255
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 This takes about 35 minutes, and because it's a lot of data actually, it's 22 gigabytes, because of the high resolution,

256
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 and we also use some kind of prioritization to get first the most important images inside the data we created.

257
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 In the third step, we do the actual detection of the boats, so finding the boats inside the image,

258
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and we realized this is a very much important step to do, because we had some users actually,

259
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 and they tried to check all of those images manually, and it was a very tiresome process,

260
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 and humans cannot keep that attention span for a very long time, especially if you're on the sea and get maybe seasick,

261
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 and you cannot analyze manually this huge amount of image.

262
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 So we think an algorithm which assists this process is very important, and therefore we decided to take

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 or use some algorithms from the neural networks family.

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Some say it's AI, but it's more I think like a pattern recognition algorithm,

265
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and there's one problem with these algorithms that they are more or less a black box,

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 which it's hard to understand and that you cannot guarantee as a programmer that it works as expected or intended.

267
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So even if there are some boats detected, we cannot guarantee that other boats, which might look similar,

268
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 are then detected afterwards again, and also those algorithms need a lot of data,

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 which we don't have because we cannot fly that much at the sea, and also we cannot create images of every possible object,

270
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 which could be out there.

271
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 So we don't generally trust these algorithms, and we always tell the people who use our software

272
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 that they still need to check every image and just use this algorithm to rank or prioritize the images

273
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 to get the most important ones first, then check those according to the prioritization.

274
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And this makes it then possible to actually get through the images in a meaningful time,

275
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 otherwise it's nearly impossible.

276
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And yeah, just a detail maybe, the object detection algorithm we use is called FastRCNN.

277
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 It's a quite old one, but it works the best for us in our use case because we have a lot of small objects,

278
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and other more modern ones don't work that well on small objects.

279
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Then the next step is the offline tracking.

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 This step combines all the information from the previous ones.

281
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 So it takes all the detections and combines them in a meaningful way.

282
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And you can see in this example here, we have here a plane at five time steps,

283
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 and you have a boat on the sea, on the ground there,

284
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and in the first time step the boat is not detected, otherwise there would be a box around it,

285
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and there are also no other waves which might have been false positively detected.

286
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So in the next time step we fly, there is a wave on the left side and the boat on the right side.

287
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 We detect the wave, and for us as humans we can see this is a false positive,

288
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 and we create a track out of this which says, okay, we use this information from the image,

289
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 calculate the real position, and we remember this position for the next time step then,

290
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 and then check if the boat or wave in this case appears again,

291
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 and then we can see if it's going, because if it's going in the next time step,

292
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 then we know, or two time steps, then we know, okay, it might not be a real boat,

293
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 because a real boat differentiates from a wave that it stays there, but the wave disappears.

294
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 So let's see what happens. So at time step three, there now we detect the actual boat and the wave again,

295
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 as a true positive in this case, then we have at time step four the boat again,

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 it gets detected, and at time step five we only detect the boat as true positive,

297
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 it gets marked with a green cross, and this says, okay, this is a real boat,

298
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 because it was detected multiple times in contrast to the wave which disappeared at some point,

299
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 and is therefore a false positive. Okay.

300
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Now the last step is the visualization. So we now combine all the information and visualize this,

301
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and you can see here in the center, that's the image, there you have a boat,

302
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 and it got like a rectangular box and a circle around it, this is the detection and the tracking information.

303
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 On the right hand side you see two lists, one list for each of the cameras inside the drone,

304
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 and below there's a small map which shows where the drone is going to.

305
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Okay, just a few more bits about the future work we're going to take with the drone.

306
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 So we want to put better cameras inside of it, because right now it's only 8 megapixels and a quite old sensor,

307
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and with a new modern camera we might be able to detect more boats or smaller ones and so on.

308
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 We also experimented with thermal sensors which would enable us to also fly by night,

309
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 because right now with the regular RGB cameras we only can fly on the daytime,

310
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and this limits us in a lot of use cases. So we tested those small thermal sensors,

311
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 they are like 200 to 300 euros, they fit into our small plane which you can see here,

312
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 but we haven't not integrated them in our real usage planes yet, but it works quite okay.

313
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 The image on the right hand side, yeah it's very hard I think to see, but in the top it shows the RGB image,

314
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and on the lower side it shows the actual thermal image, and there you maybe in the stream can see

315
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 that the actual boats and even the small buoys which are also there,

316
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 you can see them in the thermal image and therefore it would work to use these cheap sensors also in our drone.

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Okay, online boat detection is also one important thing we want to build in,

318
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 so right now we only work or do this detection of the boats after we landed,

319
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 but it would be also nice to directly get information about where the boats are while we are flying,

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 and there is ongoing work on this and we hope we can implement or deploy this soon,

321
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 and we can analyze one image with the half of the resolution in 500 milliseconds,

322
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 and it gives us already a rough information where a boat could be and they could alert the crew.

323
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Okay, long range image download is also an important thing.

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 As I said already, we only can download the images after we landed,

325
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 but it would be very important to also give the NGOs the ability to get the images while they are flying,

326
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and yeah we worked on this a lot in the recent years.

327
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 There are multiple possibilities, but we ended up with using just regular Wi-Fi

328
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 because this enables us to download regular images through it using TCP in contrast to streaming video or something,

329
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 and yeah we used their off-the-shelf hardware and we tested it with quite okay-ish results for our use case for 30 kilometers,

330
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 so maybe we hope that we can also put this into usage soon.

331
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Okay, another group in our or another part of our group also in parallel works on a completely different concept,

332
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 building instead of using like the foam based drones, building a completely different one using fiber material,

333
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and it's currently just a few days ago they flew some test missions on the Baltic Sea, I guess so,

334
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 and it was successful so maybe we can soon also get a more robust version than the foam based version

335
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 because it tends to, if there are some wakes, it might get some damage, but fiber material is way more stable in this regard.

336
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Okay, yeah here you can see how damage could look like, so it's really not nice to hit the ground,

337
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 but if you want to experience this firsthand you can of course participate in our project,

338
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 we are always looking for new members to support our project,

339
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 but you can also just spread news about our project, tell people about our project,

340
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 we also take donations, so we have an association, a German association, non-profit association, so if you have some money somewhere you don't need, please send it our way,

341
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 and of course we have a lot of technical, but not only technical problems,

342
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 the whole aspect of bringing the system into operation is a big process and we also need experts for example in operating systems in maritime environments,

343
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 so if you have any experience please join our project, yeah, so over there we have a booth,

344
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 so if you have any questions you can come there and we can talk in detail about challenges you can tackle with us,

345
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 and now there is some more time for questions, yeah, do you have any questions?

346
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I was waiting for your end slide, it didn't come, thank you for the talk,

347
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I see one question at the front already, there is my colleague coming, oh sorry I was supposed to give you the microphone, yeah,

348
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 you already spoke about on device detection, what is your biggest constraint here, is it the power budget, is it the weight, is it the run time, why is that something that you hadn't done before, or is it just time?

349
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Yeah it's time also, but also as we run on a Raspberry Pi it's not very, for image processing it's not the best platform, but I think for all the other things it's the best platform like regarding maintenance and stuff,

350
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 so it's not like super powerful for this, so we needed to find some way to find a usable option for online boat detection.

351
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Two small questions, how do you seal the 3D printed case with epoxy?

352
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Yeah we tried this too, but it didn't work out because epoxy doesn't stick to some of the printing filaments, so right now we use SLA printing,

353
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 we actually buy the waterproof box we built in Asia, so there's service to print these boxes and yeah this works quite well.

354
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And isn't Wi-Fi using too much battery?

355
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 No, I think it's maybe 5 watts or so we actually use with our Wi-Fi module, but of course it's a high power Wi-Fi module and we operate at sea, a little bit like pirates,

356
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 so we have flying pirate radio somehow and yeah of course it consumes a little bit of energy.

357
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Question over there.

358
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 So this is maybe slightly different, but have you thought about doing long endurance systems?

359
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 So I actually thought about some of this at one point in my life and I thought about building a long endurance flight that stays up for 24 hours and basically scans non-stop.

360
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 It's not impossible I think to do, when it's bad weather you might have some trouble, but if you fly higher you build a bigger train, I think it's not impossible.

361
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Yeah it's not impossible, but of course we have to somehow manage our time, so we focused on this special use case,

362
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 start from the NGO vessel and then coming back to the NGO vessel and flying, I mean we have this airplane and this frame because we also want to operate this drone on different vessels,

363
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 but of course it's possible to build bigger systems and in the beginning we saw quite big systems from Frontex and so on and of course we can try to build bigger systems.

364
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 One big drawback is maybe that if we build big systems then we have to operate them from land and then of course there's new attack vector,

365
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 the whole regulation and for example the airplanes they face these problems, but maybe we are in quite good situation with the EU drone regulation,

366
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 but it's something we are thinking about and if you are interested in that we can talk about this.

367
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Are the project specifications and the software published somewhere?

368
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Yeah we have a wiki online, wikijs and there's almost everything documented, some parts are missing which we don't have time to, but normally you should be able to build a drone using this wiki.

369
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Hi, you mentioned rescue missions, do you see your project being used one day for patrolling seas, especially when it comes to law enforcement and protecting environment against say illegal fishing?

370
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Yeah, technically this is totally possible with this, but we totally focus on rescuing humans right now and cooperate with the NGOs.

371
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Thank you, two questions, first of all have you tried an Nvidia Jetson instead of a Raspberry Pi?

372
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Yeah we thought of this, but it's too big actually for our plane right now, I have some lying around at my home, but it just doesn't fit, but it would be a nice platform for us actually.

373
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 It's also possible to make it smaller by just creating custom baseboards, so maybe at some point we are going to use it, especially if we have bigger planes.

374
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 And second question, have you thought about looking for wifi pings or phone pings from people on boats, because that can travel quite far in the ocean?

375
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Wifi pings not, but we thought of using actual GSM stuff for detecting GSM signals, there was also a test of us on the Baltic Sea, but we weren't that successful and we haven't gone into this again, but there are companies building those systems for everlaunch, people under everlaunches to detect them, so it should be possible.

376
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 But as far as I know there is nothing for open source, like the open source GSM stack, everyone should know about OsmoCom, so I haven't seen anything yet there.

377
00:38:46,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Yeah, but what we actually did, we tested the base station at sea, so actually we are interested in not only drones, so if you have any other ideas you want to explore with our association, of course you are welcome.

378
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 So for example we tested the base station at sea, but unfortunately we don't have so much time to test all the ideas we come up with.

379
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 So I wonder how well does your drone do with bad weather? I mean the worse the weather, the more urgent the rescue is, but the less stuff works typically.

380
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Yeah, so actually the waves are not a big problem, so as long as the waves are not crashing we can more or less land safely. I think in regards to waves it's more a question do you want to deploy your crew into the water?

381
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And then we can fly at 25 knots, maybe even 30 knots of wind, so the whole system is very able to withstand bad conditions.

382
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Of course it's waterproof, so we can in theory fly when it's rainy.

383
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Thank you. How many uninteresting boats do you have in these areas?

384
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Of course there are, so you mean boats which are not cases I assume, yeah of course there are for example fishermen, there's also just merchant vessels going through, yeah I mean some I can't give you any numbers, can you give any numbers? No, I don't think so.

385
00:40:40,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 But what our software can tell you for example also can tell you the size of an object in the image, so you can for example assume that a ship which is I don't know 50 or 100 meters long is of course not the case, but with smaller ships of course there's the possibility that we have a case or a fisherman is maybe the case and so on.

386
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Thanks.

387
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 We still have a bit of time, and there is another question over there.

388
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Thank you.

389
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 How many people have been rescued?

390
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Yeah, so it's actually this year the first time we really use it in this mission context really. So beginning of this year in March we operated the drone near the Canary Islands, but there are not so many cases, so the drone actually only took pictures of the ocean,

391
00:41:45,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 so we can only say okay we didn't find somebody but we covered a lot of area, and then right now the drone side, yeah I mean in the next days they maybe will find the actual case, but until now the drone didn't find any case.

392
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 But of course it's good to also find no case.

393
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Any more questions?

394
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 There is one at the front.

395
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 That might be a hypothetical question, but how hard is it for you to actually find the boat at sea, right? So it takes half an hour for the drone to get back, half an hour to download the pictures, an hour to go through them all, and then what you know is where the boat was two hours ago basically. And then with currents and them moving and you moving, like is it realistic to find them or how long does it take you to find them?

396
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Yeah we don't know, so the assumption is it takes roughly two hours, the whole process is right. Of course we don't know because we never found somebody.

397
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Yeah, I mean this two hours is the time it takes and then of course you can make assumptions. For example in the Mediterranean all people go to the north, at least if they have an engine on, and then you know maybe the speed.

398
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 We can also do assumptions by the image data about the speed of the ship, so we can tell, okay they maybe go north by I don't know three knots, and then it's maybe not so unrealistic to actually then find the case.

399
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 I think we still have two more minutes, checking with the signal, with the video people. If there are any more questions, I see you want to hear at the very front. Maybe I'm giving you just my mic.

400
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Hello, have you thought about if you do successfully find a boat and it's a couple of hours later, maybe having a shorter range one that can maybe drop a starter or a radar reflector to the boat in question so that it makes it more easier for rescuers to find?

401
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Yeah, I guess we thought about this too at some point. Yeah, but right now there's no plan to drop anything. Yeah, I think maybe not. From my point of view it would not be as necessary as might seem.

402
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Yeah, but of course it's possible. I mean if we have a little bit bigger drone, we could think about something like that.

403
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Yeah, I also think it's instead of trying to build a system which throws something, I think it's more important to just build a live transmission system that you get this information instantly and then you can directly go there.

404
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 But actually there are drones, big drones, which can drop rescue islands or rescue systems, floating devices, so this would be possible and would be maybe a demand to our politicians that they start using this and don't operate only cameras.

405
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Okay, I would say that was it. If you have any more questions, go visit the search window booth. Thank you both very much for this presentation. It was very insightful. See you around. Come to our next talk.

406
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 Thank you very much.
